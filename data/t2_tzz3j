Despite this, her government will still maintain a comfortable level of support, because the opposition is That Guy. The people who voted for leave because they opposed globalism and/or social change to their country will eventually fall into despair when you realize that these things are irreversible trends, and the future is packed full with horrible violence. The people who suffer under a Tory government will continue to suffer because no other party has the numbers to oppose their laws.

Jez will stick around until 2020, with his resignation around 2-3 years after that. Labour will have cardboard cut out replacement leader, because their party is seemingly devoid of any actual talent, or at least talent that wants to stick their head above the parapet and get covered in shit. Lib Dems will claim seats from Labour. UKIP will drop to the level of the Christian People's Party. Heard of them? Yeah, exactly. Uncertain about the upcoming Indyref, that could easily go either way.

The planet collectively fails to do anything about global warming because of our insatiable demand for more crap and we all get fucked by the spiky dildo of climate change. Sea levels rise, drinkable water becomes scarcer, migration on a bigger scale than we see currently. The governments will be unwilling to react to the impact of technology on the economy because a) they don't want to invest the money necessary to avoid huge socioeconomic upheaval and b) half of them have Series of Tubes tier understanding of the internet.

Freedom isn't freeWelcome to Qarth, the worst arc that ever was or will be.

Up until Dorne comes along.But muh oil that is absolutely required for the global economy to functionA draft is unlikely, firstly because we no longer need the huge armies and manpower we did previously, as war is becoming more and more mechanized and flying robots that kill people from the sky make up the majority of combat. Secondly, offensive wars are extremely unpopular among almost everyone in society. The Vietnam War was hugely resisted back in the 60s, which was nearly 50 years ago, and back then motivating factors like nationalism were much stronger. Imagine how big the uproar will be now.tabloid genocide when?Disappointing.

Also this largely appears to be an anti-Brexit convention aimed at people who already agree that Brexit is bad. So really you aren't swaying over or reducing UKIP support at all.

Well see I liked it for the politics and the grey, morally conflicted, interesting characters. They're all dead now though. They've been replaced with straight up good guys and bad guys and ebin CGI dragons xdIt's like Jeremy never even considered that as leader of the opposition he would be a prominent figure in the news. To him, the Media only exist to inconvenience him, and they can't be used to spread his own message or hold the government to account. I can only think he's used to not having to deal with this back when he was a backbencher, and would rather not bother learning now and would rely on the support he is used to. Which is nice, EXCEPT NOT REALLY BECAUSE YOU'RE THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION AND YOU HAVE SEATS TO WIN.

He even refused to appear [on the Mirror, Channel 4, and the New Statesman once because he was convinced they were against him.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-leadership-contest-jeremy-corbyn-hustings-biased-media-organisations-a7198171.html) They're easily the most prominent left-wing publications in the country and ones that would be the most receptive to his message, but nah fuck that shit the media is bad mkay. Now if you excuse me I must encourage the Corbyn Internet Defense Force on twitter to say that the polls are all fake.An easy target. If you applied the same cuts to the eternal OAP people would start making angry lawnmower noises on an election losing scale.No, as in all this talk of Christanity and Easter is a carefully organized distraction from something, like the time people couldn't decide on the colour of a dress on twatter. ^(ps: if you actually invested any time into that you're a total dildo)Bread and CircusesNow if only the nations of the world didn't cheat on these sorts of things to avoid having to reduce industrial outputYeah I'm honestly surprised it hasn't killed him yet.

This is someone who drew porn of him having sex with his (at the time) only female friend and sent it to her and saw nothing wrong with this. This is someone who maced a gamestop employee because Sonic's arms weren't blue. This is someone who shits in his own bed because he's too lazy to go to the bathroom. Outside of his condition he is clearly an awful person, but his parents are to blame as well. Bob tried to raise him as he was raised, which is bad if you're not an aspie and even worse if you are. Barbara is an equally shitty person who enabled all of Chris' problems, and is dying from multiple conditions that are all the result of her own sedentary lifestyle. All of these things combined with internet access produced the result you see today.

It was literally just a line they wrote so they could put it in the trailer. http://vocaroo.com/i/s1W5b2VAvbT3Thanks Michael HowardAre you lostBehold, my incredibly simplistic vague plans to improve the country interspersed with gassing people I don't like. This also assumes I am impartial and cannot be bribed (or removed from power by) certain interests:

* Brexit - Go for an transitional EEA agreement while we work out how the fuck we can alleviate the dislike of globalism and not dumpster the country into oblivion.

* Immigration - Identify and reduce migration to the lowest possible number we need to continue functioning to ease the burden on public services and housing without driving businesses who need the skills we don't have away.

* Military - Keep Trident, because getting rid of geopolitical clout under the belief that one day we will live in a magical utopia free of violence where everyone sings Kumbaya and licks each others genitals is absolutely retarded. Identify what exactly we want to do with our Military and avoid overspending. Stop stirring up shit in the Middle East for no good reason at all.

* Govt. - Keep HoL, but remove the bishops/hereditary seats UNLESS they have done good investigatory work/reporting and have irreplaceable experience. People say "oh we need to make it elected cuz reasons" well congrats you've removed everything that was good about the HoL and replaced it with the House of Commons 2.0 good job here have a shit chunk cookie. You deserve it.

* Education - Reduce numbers of people going to Uni, fund/encourage more alternate types of tertiary education such as apprenticeships, specialized colleges for certain professions such as Nurses, etc. Reduce the amount of lesson planning and busywork teachers have to do, since this is the biggest cause of teachers leaving the profession. Encourage development in the skills our population lacks, as identified by the investigation in Immigration policy. I don't know how you'd fix the issue of shitty kids. Problem is that your average parental unit is convinced their evil little bastard is 200% innocent and there is very little you can do about that.

* Employment - I'd be in favour of reducing employment discrimination by removing all identifying data and just titling them "Candidate A, Candidate B, Candidate C" and so on. Uncertain how you'd enforce this, but it's arguably the fairest and most impartial method. Ban meme attempts by employers to avoid paying minimum wage like Sandwich Artist apprenticeships and so on. On a semi related note, ban the Workfare scheme. If you do the work of a paid position, you should be paid. End of story. None of this "muh experience" bollocks that employers like to use to avoid hiring people.

* Benefits - Have the fit to work tests performed by doctors and not by private groups. The majority of rejected appeals end up being appealed and later accepted. What a waste of money.

* Housing - Encourage people to use the empty brownfield sites first to build houses on through subsidies or whatever is necessary. Look into ways to obtain more money from empty second homes/people using them as investments because fuck you, homes are for living in.

* ENNAIYCHESS - Identify which PFI schemes are worth the money and which are not, to avoid shit like the Â£100 set of blinds from Homebase story. 

* Tax - Continue to shut down loopholes and exploits in the system. Work with other nations to reduce tax-havenry. Inb4 whiny mega corporations complain. Pay your fucking taxes, asshole. ^(Also, tax anyone who thinks Daenerys Targaryen isn't a shitty character.)

* ~~Going Mad With Power~~ Societal Improvement - Pump Zyklon B into nightclubs. The emergency services will no longer be occupied by dealing with stupid people who have tragically had too much to drink despite the fact beer is horrendously overpriced to the point where [existentially challenged folk with decide that they'd rather freeze to death than go without alcohol.](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2014/12/cloakrooms-should-be-free-to-prevent-hypothermia-in-young-women/) I see no problems with this policy whatsoever.The key difference is that you laugh with right wing memes and laugh at left wing memesEverything else by the same author "Alan Spencer" is good as well. I'll just go through my Maps folder and list everything I remember enjoying:

* Tales of Robin Hood (Stronghold)

* Bretwalda (3 maps) (Stronghold)

* Minas Morgul: Faramir's Plight (Stronghold)

* The Conquest (11 maps) (Stronghold)

* Against Thee Wickedly (Stronghold)

* Festival (Stronghold)

* Candor (Stronghold)

* Defenders of the Faith (Stronghold)

* Glendalough Abbey

* The Echoing Morning Star (Stronghold)

* Fair Trade (Crusader)

* City in the Hills (Crusader)

* Hell and the Hospitaller (Crusader)

* AOC (Crusader)

* Co-Operation (Crusader)

* Battle of the Beasts (Crusader)

This shouldn't be a thing, though! Why have a first year if it doesn't count? Why not just have two years if the first year out of three is pointless?
