It will be such a satisfying thing, to watch it all unfold.

Perhaps it will cause bursting aneurysms in the likes of Bloomberg, Feinstein et al. At the subconscious level, they've realized what "school" has actually become.Looked Czech to me.Carry a few of [these](https://www.craftsy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/two1.png) (and w/ a bigger nozzle :) filled with slimy, gritty ooze. Squirt a blob of that down the crack of their ass! Cut to: int. Ripper's office. Mandrake is sitting worriedly on a couch. Ripper puts a comforting arm around his shoulder.

Ripper:

through his cigar Mandrake,

Mandrake:

Yes, Jack?

Ripper:

Have you ever seen a commie drink a glass of water?

Mandrake:

Well, no I... I can't say I have, Jack.

Ripper:

Vodka. That's what they drink, isn't it? Never water?

Mandrake:

Well I... I believe that's what they drink, Jack. Yes.

Ripper:

On no account will a commie ever drink water, and not without good reason.

Mandrake:

Oh, ah, yes. I don't quite.. see what you're getting at, Jack.

Ripper:

Water. That's what I'm getting at. Water. Mandrake, water is the source of all life. Seven tenths of this earth's surface is water. Why, you realize that.. seventy percent of you is water.

Mandrake:

Uhhh God...

Ripper:

And as human beings, you and I need fresh, pure water to replenish our precious bodily fluids.

Mandrake:

Yes. chuckles nervously

Ripper:

You beginning to understand?

Mandrake:

Yes. chuckles. begins laughing/crying quietly

Ripper:

Mandrake. Mandrake, have you never wondered why I drink only distilled water, or rain water, and only pure grain alcohol?

Mandrake:

Well it did occur to me, Jack, yes.

Ripper:

Have you ever heard of a thing called fluoridation? Fluoridation of water?

Mandrake:

Ah, yes, I have heard of that, Jack. Yes.

Ripper:

Well do you now what it is?

Mandrake:

No. No, I don't know what it is. No.

Ripper:

Do you realize that fluoridation is the most monstrously conceived and dangerous communist plot we have ever had to face? Fuck I hope Berkeley is a nuclear target, even if it's from one of our own.

Just a small yield tactical though, just remove that abscess that calls itself a university.  Maybe a MOAB for city hall.That's giant billboard material right there.

"Job Security."[Fo' sho'](http://cruisingundersail.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Terry-in-Bosuns-chair.jpg)Perhaps more stern wording on those "Gun Free Zone" signs?

That might help.>  because of our superior intellect

Hahahahahahaaaaaa!As a Texan, I have the right to shoot you in the face if you try & take anything.

My bullets are halal, come and freely take them. Please.The Larping is strong with this one...You obviously didn't read enough of my history to make a fair and accurate assessment, so go piss up a rope.Yeah, we're ~~disgusting~~ *Deplorable*, so fuck you both.

*You* are completely right and actually, I agree with everything you said.

> people are still having an emotional response to the event

Do you think that is why the media & the politicos quickly do exactly that, to hit the masses with a barrage of "gun law reform etc" while emotions are heightened and raw? 

And just what does the media, politicians & every other misguided hoplophobe do *immediately after any event*? They start harping about "need more [woefully ineffective] gun laws blahblahblah" ad nauseum.

Nah, fuck that, fuck you and every thing about you.With so many different genders to choose from lately, how can I tell which one is "opposite"?Fuck off with your stupidity & ignorance.This happened in California??

Impossible. They have awesome gun laws that prevent this very thing. Also, pretty sure that school is a "Gun Free Zone", so nobody would be bringing firarms there.Suck it, EVH.Roger that. Else be prepared, for an unending stream of "Uncle Daddy" jokes/references will be aplenty.It's anatomically incorrect.They eat their younglings on moonless nights.Misogyny, racism, hate, whateverphobia etc. et al ad nauseum, are all being kept alive & kicking by the likes of CNNABCMSNBCNBCHUFFPOWAPOCBS^® .

I'm going to try them out tomorrow on some work friends who I've been  unable to teach to X-view.>...government surveillance of all Americans

I swear sometimes I get the distinct impression that most simply do not care. When I point out to friends/family how FB (and, quite likely, most others,) can at any time, turn on the users mic or camera, the typical reaction is "oh! that explains how I'll be talking about something & next thing ya know I'm getting ads for that very thing *lol* ". When I point out that the feature could be exploited by hackers, pedophiles & the like, they usually shrug & get blank, stupid looks on their faces.

Sad really.[First reaction.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--28aZlJcduM/UyjrNj3wHFI/AAAAAAAAHDM/ltXc6Ay1yVg/s1600/600full-the-bad-seed-.jpg)Cheaper when you build [the kind you want.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvuxSM_hV5E)

**A**irsoftFor so very, very many of them, the butthurt is still very real and very palpable. This gives rise to desperation, which leads to sub-optimal results in their anemic efforts.

One cannot however, deny the intrinsic entertainment value, watching some of them just go stupid, (in that cringey sort of way that's kinda funny, but still, you're thinking in the back of your head of ways to maybe do something permanately damaging to their reproductive organs).I'm sure the Muslim Community appreciates this.Methinks a pair of gloves with the hook side of velcro sewn onto a couple of fingers will help snag their little pussy masks and pull them down. Also marinate those gloves in habanero pepper juice and rub it into their eyes for optimal crybully tear count.> poached

It's just that, well, like [this guy,](http://www.pbr.com/media/resized/48613_0_648x365.jpg) I've gotten to a point in my life where I prefer to feed myself, bathe myself & what not and also wiping my own ass, and not some disgruntled, underpaid "caretaker" trying to do all that for me.
