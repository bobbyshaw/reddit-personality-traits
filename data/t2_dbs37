Someone find that potato and lentil stew gif recipeLast two weeks:

**Lion (2016)** 7.5/10

It doesn't fall apart but the first half is much more unique and captivating than the second half where we're getting some cliches and the emotion doesn't hit as hard. Just an uneven film but I think it deserves a good rating just for doing a decent job of telling a worthwhile story, never getting too downbeat.

**La La Land (2016)** 7/10

Yeah...Cafe Society was better imo. I knew I was never gonna like this film much based on how it's a musical mixed in with a bit of a Disney film but I didn't think it would be as superficial. Take away the glamour and you're left with a weak romantic comedy-drama imo but I guess people are easily impressed by choreography. I did think the lighting/colours were amazing and while I'm not a fan of Emma Stone, her chemistry with Ryan Gosling who was fantastic made me give it a bit of a higher grade than I would on story alone.

**Ordinary People (1980)** 7.5/10

Definetely some similarities to Manchester By The Sea and it isn't quite dated but it really isn't as good. I think the issue is that the script just isn't fully there in some scenes like the closer with the psychiatrist. There are some gems that work well though like the kid and his hospital friend in the diner or a couple scenes with him and his mom. Anyways, uneven film but it does stand out for its acting and how it deals with the subject matter which another 80s or 70s film would've screwed up in a cliched way.

**Le Samourai (1967)** - 9/10

Not finished this one yet but I'm loving it, very good mix of a noir/gangster film with a murder mystery thrown in. Big fan of a guy being chased while chasing someone. Cold colours work better here than in Army of Shadows.> The vocals are irritatingly loud on Slomo.

12. PabloLeave it to the British to do it betterThis guy rated The Bends number 7? I know album ranknigs are always personal and it varies a lot with Radiohead but the gap between The Bends and OKC is not that big lol even the stylistic gap isn't as big as people think.

I never agree with most of this guys reviews and find his taste very P4K so what do I know.It's fine I doubt any Reddit admins are ever gonna poke their head in this little corner. Though I'm gonna wait after the official release myself, still going through albums from last month and they keep releasing new ones.DuPont are the ones that did that? Those illuminati bastards! WHYYYYYYY!The ones on /r/Hockey are worse imo, they delete posts very inconsistently. 

Anyways I like HFBoards, I get a lot of good knowledge and insight from there. I know that for the Avs, the Avs subreddit here is like delusional children or new fans compared to the Avs board of HF.So are the Avs, technically we've won the same number of games these playoffs.I liked the cold cinematography of Prisoners a bit more than Sicario, very clean looking.Hi! Not much going on now but excitement will come at the drafts. Should always have two teams.I didn't downvote you other people did I was just pointing out why they did. I agree with all of what you said outside of Bednar being a puppet, imo Bednar's just a really bad coach but not a puppet.That Forsberg. So hot right now.You underestimate how patient Joe Sakic is. I was shaking my head listening to his interviews after the trade deadline lmao. But he is due to be forced to make a move at this point, I think.

Hopefully he makes more than one, moving Duchene alone won't fix anything nor will it be enough of a move to signal going forward with a rebuild.You got downvoted for these reasons:

-I'm not a draft expert but from everything I've followed, there's no clear #1 dman in this draft. Lilljegren who was highest rated coming into the year is considered weak now and some don't even have him in their top 20. The fact is that in the first 3-4 picks, forwards are much better in this draft sadly. BUT this is okay, our offense sucks as bad as our defence, our defence has just sucked for longer so people are focused on that. We need some energetic and smart young forwards, we'll likely be bad next year and 2018's draft has some dmen to offer in terms of high picks.

-You criticized Joe Sakic, tis a no-no around here lol. He does deserve it though I was calling for his head after last off-season after seeing how he failed to do anything to improve the defence

-You called Bednar a puppet. While he's a shitty AHL level coach, coaches are not puppets, they run their own systems and allocate ice-time. Bednar has full responsibility for stuff like how the team comes out per period. Of course Sakic has contributed to the problem with a bad roster but Bednar's coaching is pretty uninspired.Does Trotz know that the point of cycling the puck is to shoot and score and not to just cycle the puck lol?Didn't the Sens get screwed over with no call against Boston on a couple plays in the first?

Can't we just agree that playoff reffing is bad all-around?I believe this was a make or break year for them anyways due to their contract situation so they will have to retool a bit regardless but trading Ovy/Backstrom lol what?That's a Mike Babcock problem. There's a reason they managed to finish last last year and still kept staying close in games or having problems defending leads this year.

The guy just goes too conservative. The Leafs start treating the puck like a hot potato when they get a lead. They need to defend like how the Pens do, by keeping the puck in the other teams zone and cycling as much as they can but instead they'll just try to get it in deep.I never heard it my whole life either and I spent it all in Ontario. I think it was a regional term made popular by TV.Their 3rd and 4th lines have more depth going in, I thought this before the series as well so I was surprised to see people say Caps will win in 4 or 5.

And the Caps' top-six is better than the Leafs imo but it's not like those guys are playoff beasts based on past evidence. This was a very interesting 90s British band, the album they released after this debut was very cool, like a mix of Britpop & Prog Rock. Anyways, I'd recommend downloading the single version of the song Taxloss from this album (the one on here is too long), it also has an interesting music video.

I actually just posted an article on them earlier today on the British rock sub:

https://www.reddit.com/r/UKbands/comments/65tuuk/mansuns_legacy/I'm watching it now and barely ever remember that happening lol.That show was never average. It went from being really good to bad to pretty bad.

I think OP is asking for stuff that's just right in the middle, never that good or bad. Most 1-hour procedurals on US TV would fit.-More concerning is that basketball has a younger demographic of fan base in Canada compared to Hockey, doesn't bode all that well for the NHL going forward.

-Drama. My high school and grade school classes were filled with people arguing over Lebron, Kobe, Shaq, Iverson, etc back in the 2000s. There was a tonne of stuff going on in b-ball, a lot of drama that hockey doesn't have to the same extent. That sport marketed its stars better while hockey still struggles to. People are attracted to drama and storylines and hockey's fairly tame. Plus the dead puck era and dead puck era 2.0 have killed off interest

-I don't buy the money argument completely. You don't have to play hockey to become a fan but one way to circumvent the cost issue is floor/street hockey (I've never been on ice a day of my life). This does take effort though and the NHL would need to launch programs and incentives to get ball hockey everywhere but it doesn't. As an example in Canada, Rugby Canada started sending former players to some high schools to start teaching the rules of Rugby in Gym classes. In Canada it's very uneven, some schools have hockey while other high school gyms don't even own floor hockey sticks. You could go through the Canadian schooling system without ever playing hockey but you're definetely gonna have to play basketball, a lot. Hockey Canada (and I'd guess the American one too) also have no interest in getting kids into playing floor hockey. Their programs all involve getting kids on the ice because they get money from kids being registered in programs set in arenas not kids playing on the street or gyms so they don't make that long-term investment into ball hockey.

-I think the answer is just a lot more simple than all of this though. While the stuff above contributes, the answer is really just offense and flashiness. Basketball is exciting (not for me tbh), every play is like a highlight. In hockey meanwhile, offense is tight and most of these playoff games have been low scoring, the regular season isn't much better. When we do have goals, they're usually the garbage or through traffic variety, we don't really see star players being able to use their skill to score all that much.I'm a bit concerned about how our dollar is being kept low and can't get to .80 even with the recovery.Yeah especially the first disc of that Kleptomaniac CD, it has b+sides from their earlier days and they're better than the third album. I think they're also on the collectors edition of their debut.House of Cards was more entertaining but it's quite sleazy and I found I got a lot more out of the West Wing. It's a bit more educational, inspiring, makes you think more, etc. I should add I'm only on season 3 of West Wing but I'm glad I saw it.

Cocteau Twins and The Sundays>  there's no harm in keeping Bednar

Bad coaches running poor systems ruin a players potential. Duchene/Landeskog/Mac are good examples.You know while I like Chris Taggert, I watched the West Wing afterwards and couldn't help but feel like Chris was a waste of Rob Lowe's acting ability.This is unfair. Last year they pull Rust & Sheary out of their ass now they have Guentzal. Why can't we have these things?I was being sarcastic lolYeah true the difference isn't as big in this example as it is in other ones like songs from The Bends but it still applies I think. How do I describe this.....his voice is completely subdued here, I don't think it's off-pitch more like that it now sounds like a bad knock-off of the original.Yeah but would you rather take it easy and go golfing early or spend all your energy trying and still end up golfing early?

Joke's on themYeah but there's the implicationI'm not denying that Allen's been good but he's mostly making good positional saves and the Wild are failing to generate lateral puck movement plus they're taking a tonne of periphery shots. The ones they get in close are right into his pads.

I don't completely blame them for this, these playoffs are very low scoring and it's hard to get a shot off from a dangerous area with any time so it's usually a quick low shot but still, there's something wrong with how Boudreau coaches his teams in terms of the quality of chances they generate. There's a reason goalies keep looking elite against him in the playoffs.Those two were shit this year and have checked out. I look forward to getting rid of them and getting on with our rebuild.BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUL SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT. He took over in August and he had all of training camp with them. Other coaches were missing more players due to the Olympics. He had more than enough time to implement a system or to adjust it.

Idiot managed to turn a bad team into a record breaking one.It's pretty much the same players.I. Want. Dahlin.Wow he sounds even worse this year than last, band sounds good though.A combo of IMDb/letterboxd/criticker ratings plus genre and premise are enough for me usually. Barely ever watch a bad movie this way except when I ignore the stuff above.And there's still people here willing to give Bednar & the front office a chance thinking they can turn our team into that. There's no chance, most of our roster doesn't have that compete.By God that's Joe Sakic's music!I miss Britpop+cumin, coriander, & chili flakes...very useful in soups and stewsDERMOTT WITH THE CHAIR!There were a few Leafs fans clapping the boards that camera angle didn't show till after, I think he was clapping back.Thanks KesselYeah! Only thing that's left for him to do is quit the Blackhawks while he's ahead and come back to coach the Avs.You can take a player out of the Avs but you can't take the Avs out of a playerThe DoPS are such cowards, they hide behind precedent and a rulebook that they only follow when convenient.Could we stop dirtying up our sub with posts about the friggin Wild? Stop giving a shit about them we got troubles of our own.I'd trade Grigorenko's rights if possible tbh, getting a 3rd round pick or something out of it, guy's got no pulse.Lmao Holden's been so bad. Roy's 'favourite dman', idiotMinnesota Wild, Washington Capitals, New York Islanders....the NHL has a weird geography fetish.It's conservatives worldwide tbh whether they're in the UK or Canada or Oz. They're always the rich party trying to get richer while maintaining their status and they screw over the average person but easily brainwashed or just uneducated idiots keep voting them in.Reminded me of this for some reason

Oh they can definitely keep up with the Caps the question is just whether they can keep up for 60 minutes if they're the ones to get a lead first. 

I do think that it's from Babcock being a bit conservative and I expect that in the future once the team gets better, he might loosen up and let them go a bit more and not focus so much on just defending.I like their former sound more which is like Royal Blood's current sound so I do like the genre or style of the Royal Blood song but in terms of the songs alone, I thought the BRS was better (catchier at least).I liked the new [Blood Red Shoes](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKbands/comments/64sg25/blood_red_shoes_eye_to_eye_2017/) song from yesterday more but I like the type of sound used in this song more (I have a preference towards guitars over synths or in this case a bass that sounds like a guitar).

Anyways my point is that it's a nice coincidence that Brighton's two best rock duos put new music out within two days.She seemed to know what skates are but not what the 'hockey term' for skates is.Fuck new territory. Gimme Royal Blood Part 2 if it's just as good and shove new territory up your Pitchfork.Exhibit 32931 of the NHL's failure to market the game's basic lexicon to the public in major cities let alone Southern markets lmao.It's come down to this?Yeah Elliot Friedman spoiled it yesterday so they just released this to confirm I guessSuperlux HD668B

I prefer the budget earbud route though (VE Monk+, $5 online + shipping)Someone photoshop Sakic's head on Costanza's!

https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/15/6f/8a/156f8a7fcd1be1db25545017b1cbe71c.jpgWhat's up with the Bednar shills on this sub constantly bringing up some past user whenever someone has the gall to say that here might be a better NHL-level coach available than Bednar?Look at all these coaches coming and going, coming and going. Annnnnyday no Sakic.OP if you're using a Moto E then you gotta root it and go with Viper4Android instead of PowerAmp.

Anywyas, my own problem is that since my Sansa Fuze broke cos of the wheel being messed up, I haven't had a proper mp3 player. I have an iPod Nano 7G I use for my better songs but it tops out at 12 GB with no external memory option and obviously it doesn't have much in terms of sound quality or EQ (it can't be rockboxed either). For listening to full albums for the first several times I put them on my phone, usually 3-5 at a time. Definetely gonna need a new mp3 player once that Nano runs out of space but I do love the 7G Nano's interface and how it functions in terms of using a touch screen.Tbh they both suck and we're probably gonna lose neither as Vegas will have better options.During the 2006 playoffs, the Oilers out of nowhere played the Hurricanes....one year after Hurricane Katrina came and drove gas prices way up. And the Oilers lost to the Hurricanes.....coincidence or illuminati?Nah it's mostly just obstruction and holding.Not his fault Sakic couldn't even negotiate a 7th round pick.I wish we could expose both these guys along with half the rest of our pathetic roster and our coaching staff and our front office.Babish, Stanley is infuriating to me. Especially in the episode with Josh, Babish is a pro and doing his job to a tee, Stanley's like a poor man's idea of what a psychiatrist or psychologist is but he has the two mixed up. 

Also I really hate Abby and I love when Babish lays the smackdown on her when she's trying to be a smartass without being smug while Stanley always has this annoying smugness about him.Yeaaaah.....we need to trade his rights and get something back before he walks. Historically when it gets this close, the guy walks and he has nothing to lose at this point waiting to hit FA in August. I know I would if I were him, he did his four years and we waited till the end to sign him plus we have given preference to veteran dmen instead of prospects this year and there's multiple prospects ahead of him on our depth chart so if I were him, I'd try to find a higher bidder who guarantees an opening roster spot or something.
Old Keane song back when they still used the guitar before their first album.With one song in the top 20 by a British indie band.....thanks NME (treasonous sell-outs).Yeah the Keane song is old before their first album before and before they went piano rock and still had a guitarist. 

To be more serious, the vocals from the Radiohead version sound very much like a 2000s indie rock band like The Strokes but the instrumentals are a bit baroque or chamber pop (maybe Tindersticks would be a decent comparison). That album is also a bit jazzy and Morphine were a band that did a lot of jazz rock with heavy usage of bass & sax.Does this one still have the problem that it only works if the other person also has it and enables encryption?Wolf At The Door by KeaneWatch some Sakic shill come here and say that Hitchcock wouldn't be the right fit with our players the same way they were trying to say Bednar is a better fit than Ruff or Sutter.Perfect Symmetry by Keane (the album version of the song not the single version), it's a grower. Their singer also did a couple covers of Queen and has impressive vocals but those two covers are a bit more pop.

You could theoretically install a ROM without GAPPS and then not install a play store or any Google apps and use alternatives for all of them but then your phone is Android owned by Google so they might have some backdoor access.Wait, earplugs at movies/airplanes/buses? None of those are loud enough for hearing damage are they? I guess airplanes are but only if you're flying regularly and on long flights.

Movies have loud parts in them but I definitely don't think they're loud enough in general in terms of the parts that have dialogue unless you're watching it in booming IMAX and even then, earplugs would make it very difficult to hear the dialogue.The team's preference for veterans like Beuchemin, Tyutin, and Weircioch followed by bringing in external options this season instead of giving more time to Bigras/Boikov/Lindholm/Siemens does not reflect well on a 'rebuilding team' and his agents or advisers will probably put that into consideration.

Basically Sakic's respect of veterans or whatever is gonna bite us in the ass.

Also he might've won the Hobey Baker but you guys shouldn't forget we still have Mironov and Meloche who I personally consider better prospects than Butcher. Failing to sign him isn't the end of the world it's just another bad reflection on mgmt.So they believed he was a Russian agent and monitored him.....were they able to get proof that he was or are we waiting now on their investigation?New Royal Blood album announcement and new Blood Red Shoes song in the same day, hehNoooo THIS is form an alternate universe

http://imgur.com/a/63RdJWhen are you gonna write a book on hockey history or a journalistic over the course of a season 'A Season In Time' style book through the lens of working in the media during a full season? Sorry for the run-on sentence but my point is, write a book!Then Andrighetto would be exposed.
