You're right. I think idgod could defo have a decent copyright infrigment suit on his handsHe's looking into making driving licenses. 

Ukfakes is willing to sell him holograms and shit.

/u/idgod is a pretty big vendor on the US fake ID subreddit so it would be nice to have someâ€‹ healthy competition on here.

Imo it will be months (maybe 6 but your guess is as good as mine) until an actual product will be available, but it will hopefully be very high qualityI'm in total agreement with you, but other people aren't, and that's why there is a debate. 

I think I'm misscommunicating my point, Im just trying to say no one can say hemp should be in any way illegal, and just shows how silly the law is, and how corrupt the government can be.
Could be for navigation, or to control the GoPro on the dad's headI totally agree. But there is at least a debate to be had around that, whether weed should or should not be legalized (obviously should) there is literally no reason to ban a non psychoactive plant.Strong, cheap, renewable resource that's not psychoactive?

Think of the children!Thanks man!The answer to your question is no

Edit: deleted now, but someone said "you choose a beef analogy when thinking of India?" 

Or something along those lines, the actual comment made less sense.India is inside Asia, therefore Indians are also Asian. 


A slice of bacon is still a refrigerated item even though it is in the meat draw of the fridgeNah, I'll just put 100FREECAPS thanksYeah but cut out the 2 minutes of footage everyone has already seen which made it more accessible imoAnd the music was pointless and annoying. 

But good info I thoughtDamn. That's not good. Hope you get it sorted"I don't know about this but it is bad"Thanks I was looking for thisfor entertainment purposes.

Next questionMake meI agree, but personally I wouldn't want risk the video never coming to light, and it simply being her and her friends word against mine and my friends. 

That girl is a terrible person, and deserves to see full assault and battery charges, but im glad I'm not the one that has to try and get her chargedThe video is from one of her friends, what are the chances of her making the video known to a judge, say it went to trial. She wouldn't have uploaded the evidence if her freind was pressingâ€‹chargesNeither would I, but the courts often see different.Thought you were kidding about the nameHow much phenibut would u normally have if you were taking 3gs of shrooms?Allow me to introduce you to the world of 'online journalism'

Where the headline is everything, and facts and sources don't exist!Definitely manslaughter, But it would suggest it is conspiracy to murder or attempted murder or whatever ever the exact term would be.

Presuming they were going to sell it as herion (or anything but fentanyl) they are causing many deaths, just for there monatary gain.?? He can always change his situation and maybe not be dependent on drugs later in his life, but he can't do that if he kills himself>Want freedom and to be able to be on my own and do what I like whenever I want.

>Crippling lonelinessGod damnNight schoolStill three stars thoughHey, no need to be so harshI just finished.

I alternated between putting the liquid on q tips/paper towel and just squirting it right on the area using the tube.

I would say applying it directly to the area is probably not good for you, but it gets it colder.

I was kinda frustrated because it was so pain free, so felt like it wasn't doing anything, but we'll see in the next few days how effective it was.

Once it was numb from the cold, I sort of took of the outer layer of skin covering the wart, to get the cold closer to the root.

The fumes made me feel a bit lightheaded, like airfix glue, so I would suggest doing it in a well ventilated area, or next to a Window or something. I could of been imagining this though.


I'll report back in a CPL of days on any changes.


Thanks for the idea!How come ppl are asking for PM's can you not post the pics?

You could maybe blur out ur face or somethingOrdered compressed air, gonna try tomorrow. Wish me luck!Yeah I loved it. He has two on atm. One from 2016, and one from a few years back.

Sealed envelopes through the post are unnaceptableMax dimensions for a portrait Instagram pic is 4x5

Edit: that pic is about 16:9.

It could be from an insta story, which can be that size, but you can't put the tilt shift effect on insta storyNah, the pics too tallOkay thanks very much. I think I'm gonna give it a miss, I don't think it's the right time. Gonna vape and ABV. Thanksâ€‹ for the advice. 

Got nearly a year's worth of resin so I would probably die lol.
Those Honey nut Cheerios sound great lol.Yeah, If I drink it at 1:00-1:30 It should kick in by 2:30. I'll try not to eat much before hand. 


Have u ever done it?More like NSFL, disgusting. Not at all, I'm jealous lol. 

Enjoy urself, and stay safe What does impe mean?

Sorry if it's obvious, but I googled it and nothing came upYou get about don't you ðŸ˜‚/r/hmmmThis is quite silly, as there is no freedom of speech laws in England, and you can literally go to jail for what you say.I like the 'lied about the start time' idea. 

Never really saw it as that malicious but you're totally right. It's ridiculousThe waking deadHmmmPoor doggo's thoughDon't let that dude put you off asking questions and researching stuff. Have a good evening ðŸ˜ŠSo bad. If they had it the other way round they would of at least got 1/2 right. KindaHmmYeah, more safety features these daysCoolOh really, i didn't know that. So crazy lol. 

Thought having no power of great Britain would be enough for herGood question. Needs an answer.

I can give you one, but it won't be right.

Technically they're not under British rule anymore, so the flag is only on their flag because they're were under British rule, and the Britain that owned Australia for example will not be historically changed, so for them to update to new flag would suggest Britain still had some influence on them

Idk what would happen,I piss warm. UsuallyPeople came into my school and put on a video about a guy that had schizophrenia, and smoked weed, and then the guy started saying he was the devil, and shouting at his mom. They suggested this can happen to anyone that has a hit of weed.

When i asked about the legalisation in Colorado ( that had happened the same week) they just glossed over it and swept it under the carpet.That would make him nearly 100 lolAwwwwwwwwwI thought about it, and for about a year, I listened to the pabs way more than any one in my family, who I live with.



No ragretsYeah, found the moon landing stuff interesting, but it really annoyed me when he claimed film doesn't retain itself through the atmosphere, but then gave nothing that proves that or backed it up. I could just Google it, but I'm lazyLol that got batshit crazy hahah.

Loved when he was accusing Obama of being gay and having gay prostitute parties, and Joe was like do you have any evidence at all of this, and he just steamrolled right over him lol[Hey, I took a very similar pic just a couple of weeks ago](http://i.imgur.com/GqVv2GJ.jpg)My mum died giving birth to me. ThanksThat's so shit ðŸ˜‚Hey it's me your garbage canWhat ID did you use if u don't mind me asking? 

And does the city have big red and blue football teams?Yeah... While trippingThat's awesomeYeah, I get you/r/mildlyinfuriating it's so close to being centered.I don't get it? :(Good epYo...I think he might have been joking though
Me_irlThe problem is that there are about a dozen cameras in every household, connected to the internet. And if it is connected to the internet, it can be hacked. 

Same with microphones.It is nowTrueThat's upsetting. He seems like he'd be a good father. Perhaps he didn't get to spend much time with him what with being a judge.What did you have to do with the movement of weed in the bottom of the worldI am currently working on the day of the firstI wish I had the strength to follow you.
Facebook is a shitty site and a shitty companyWtfI have swipe instead of Facebook nowJesus turned water into wine which is a drug. That's pretty chill. 



Also, there is a theory (that I don't believe) that Christianity was birthed by people on mushrooms, Moses and the burning bush, god speaking to Moses. Not particularly relevant but interesting.And you don't even have a sonWorked 9/10 times at tesco, but one time two different ppl were called over, one being the manager, and none had ever seen a citizen card, but no problems getting my card back or anything.
