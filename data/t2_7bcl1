I have never called the police. I have never called the fire department. I don't walk on the sidewalk. I don't have any kids so I won't be paying for schools.

I've also never went to a museum. I have never went to a play. I've never been an artist.

The idiotic Republican view is that I should not have to pay for things I don't use.

The correct Democratic view is that I pay for things that other people use.

I pay taxes so that other people with kids can send their kids to school. I pay taxes so other people can walk on the sidewalk. I pay taxes so other people get to go to museums. I pay taxes so other people can call the police, or have fireman show up when their house is on fire.

Not to say I couldn't use those things. But I don't use those things. The correct answer is higher taxes to pay for things I do not use. Just in case you weren't sure: body searches themselves, no matter how thorough, are pointless.

More people need to be performing searches like this guy.

Eventually we can transition to stop performing body searches.

That's why it's called "security theater." Like going to the theater, or going to the movies: it makes you feel better. You feel good. You feel safer. You aren't actually any safer. But you feel more secure.

Then what happened south of the border that made them so homicidal.

In fact there is no *difference* you can find that accounts for it. Everything else about the countries is the same.


Up until the American Revolution we were identical.

- British colonies
- British people
- in the new world
- same language
- same culture
- same religion
- same language
- same region of the new world
- got own Constitutions at same time (1787 US, four years later for Canada)

From then on the two brothers grew up side by side. 

- both pioneered the West
- built railroads
- both slaughtered a century's worth of native Americans
- trade with each other
- electrification
- brought the same cars
- same leaded gasoline
- listen to the same radio broadcasts
- fought in the same Great War
- fought the same WWII
- watch the same television signals
- fought the same Korean War
- smoke the same cigarettes
- watch the same movies
- fought in the same Vietnam
- watched the same Johnny Carson, Threes Company, Dukes of Hazzard, Dallas, Cheers, The Cosby Show, Simpsons, Star Trek, Seinfeld, The X-Files, The Sopranos, Six Feet Under
- played the same Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Mario Brothers, LodeRunner, Seven Cities of Gold, Tetris, Wolfenstein, Doom, Final Fantasy, Pokemon, Zelda, Grand Theft
- have the same regional accents
- both allow people to own guns

But if you look at the homicide rates north and south of the international border..

I mean, Oregon Country was arbitrarily divided horizontally along the 49th parallel, and two centuries later they have vastly different murder rates.

- breathe the same air
- drink from the same Great Lakes
- banned the same lead in gasoline
- smoke the same cigarettes
- smoke the same marijuana
- sniff the same cocaine
- inject the same heroin

Why is it two comparable sized cities, a few hours apart, have such vastly different homicide rates

Americans are just more homicidal by NatureI wasn't comparing any law. I was comparing two identical groups of people.

Whatever this group of British subjects did on the same land as that group of British subjects didn't do, made Americans more homicidal by nature.A can't; I've already been banned after one post :(Watch:

In fairness,  this system I saw was in 1997.Even worse: you were essentially just told the other users name and passwordThe US and Canada are a good test case because:

- both British colonies
- both got Independence
- we have the same language
- we have the same religion
- we watch the save TV shows
- we watch the same movies
- we have the same movie stars
- we play the same violent video games
- same popular music
- we both grew up watching Tom Brokaw Peter Jennings Connie Chung Dan Rather Stone Phillips
- both own PS4 and Xbone
- both watch Netflix
- both watch YouTube
- both browse Reddit



It's a near-perfect side by side laboratory experiment.

Economist do something similar with side by side States. You want to examine the effect of a new policy and you look at two neighboring states who are similar in most respects except one Implement a policy change. You can watch the effect on one vs. the other.

Why is it that Vancouver British Columbia has a homicide rate 1/5 at of Vancouver Washington few hours to the South. Both large cities. Both on the west coast. Both rainy and cloudy. Don't speak English. Drink the same water. Breathe the same air.

Why is it drunken 20-somethings are more likely to kill each other in the US over Canada. Something in the US psyche that just makes then more homicidal.
> 35 Million vs 316 Million population difference might be a factor

Look at the homicide **rate** (aka the *height* of the bars; the width is population)

And if you run the numbers based on large cities it still doesn't work. Nor does population density. Nor does education level, per-capita GDP, gun ownership rates, or crime rates. Americans are simply more homicidal by nature.There was a system where users were uniquely identified by the key:

In this case DRM means hdcp. Everyone participating hdcp has to swear that:

- from the content being played 
- all the way to the monitor 

it is encrypted. Video cards certify that they are hdcp compliant. Compliance for a hardware manufacturer means taking physical steps to ensure or someone can not get at the content.

The video card drivers must be hdcp compliant. The os must be hdcp compliant. The monitor must be hdcp compliant. And everyone in this chain communicates and indicates they are compliant.

Windows added support for hdcp with Windows Vista so that you could watch Blu-ray videos on your PC. If they didn't do that, you would not be able to watch Blu-ray videos on your PC.

We can be stuck with flash forever. It's fine.

There's DRM whether you want it or not. 

So you have two choices:

- keep web standards intellectually pure, while browsers ship DRM-capable video player *de-facto* standard
- have web standards reflect reality

It doesn't.

From Annex II of the rule:

The plug shall meet the USB- IF Connector Test Requirements  (http://www.usb.org/developers/compliance/connectors/), shall be compliant to the Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification, Rev 1.01 (Micro-USB 1.01), and shall be rated to meet all electrical specifications.

It's as dumb as standardizing on the Centronics connector for printers (you don't remember, but **every** printer had a Centronics connector). It leaves no room for improvement.

It doesn't allow for future improvements, like the USB-C reversible connector.

USB-C is not zero insertion force (ZIF). It bars future ZIF connectors. 

The government should not be mandating today's technology -  two months after they announced the requirement USB-C was finalized. 

It's as dumb as mandating 15-pin video connectors. Or mandating DVI. Or mandating HDMI. Or mandating 80-pin IDE.

It limits innovation - like Apple's reversible, zero insertion force, high power, video capable, connector.

Kill the messenger!I assume the post that got me banned is still visible, just heavily downvoted.It's ironic question come up today, shortly after i wanted a video on [the freedoms of the air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thqbjA2DC-E). 

The 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation established the International Civil Aviation Organization. They laid out five freedoms of the air:

1. The right to fly over a foreign country without landing (e.g. Delta can fly over Canada to get to Alaska)
2. The right to land in foreign countries for technical stops (e.g. Delta can land in Canada to refuel on it's way to Alaska)
3. The right to fly from one's own country to another country (e.g. Delta can fly to UK)
4. The right to fly from another country back to one's own (e.g. Delta can fly from UK back to US)
5. The right to fly to multiple foreign countries for flights starting, or ending at home (e.g. Delta can fly from Germany, land in France, and then continue to US)

And then there are other freedoms; but not standardized:

6. The right for Delta to carry passengers from Canada to UK (Canada -> US -> UK)
7. Right to fly between two foreign countries without connecting to home
8. Right to fly between two cities in a foreign country, and then continue on to home country (e.g. Paris -> Lyon -> US)
9. Right to fly between two cities in a foreign country, without continuing on to it's own country (e.g. Air Canada flying Detroit -> Baltimore)


**Edit**: To be clear: i'm only offering more information about the subject.Hardware requirements were minimal.

Windows Vista beta, inside Virtual PC, ran faster than the Windows XP PC i was running it on. (paradoxical; but understandable).

People ***hated*** not being an administrator.

Software developers had to suffer the pains of making their software work as standard user. And Windows Vista became the sacrificial goat.

Everything you know and love about Windows 7 came about from Windows Vista:

- DirectX virtualization (does anyone here remember when you could only run one DirectX app at a time?)
- per-process volume control
- searchable start menu
- user-mode video card drivers (video card driver can crash and not take down the system)
- high-dpi support
- direct video compositing and hardware acceleration
- dpi virtualization
- UAC
- protected mode/low integrity processes
- user-mode drivers

In many ways there i things i prefer about Vista over 7. And even though i'm running 10: i can't stand it.

There are many things about Vista i wish i could bring back:

- **Gadgets**. Gadgets in Windows Vista had a definite home; a place where they sat. People found them and used them. The glass effect of the sidebar was a nice high-quality touch. The fact that gadgets automatically positioned and adjusted themselves in the sidebar was also a nice touch.
- **Glass Frame**. In Windows Vista, when a window was maximized, the "glass" portion of the frame became black and opaque. [i would have preferred if there was a transition to black oqaque - but what the hell, i'll take it](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cjacks/archive/2006/06/21/641735.aspx). Starting with Windows 7 the glass frame was always transparent. This meant that the top caption bar, address bar, etc, were hard to read with stuff from the window behind. The content behind could also cause problems depending on the pattern
- **Aero Peek**. While i love the taller taskbar introduced with Windows 7, and the pinning items, and the clock also showing the date, (which were long overdue), i don't like aero peek. Hovering over a taskbar button of a running application shows a preview of that application - fine. Vista had that. But if i move the mouse over that window, suddenly the entire screen changes to something. It becomes a nightmare if you accidentally hover over a taskbar button. The thumbnail preview *"hint"* window appears. Fine, i'll just move my mouse off the taskbar button. But then the entire screen flashes and you've lost where you were (because you accidentally left the mouse on top of the thumbnail). This becomes especially troublesome if you were playing a real-time online game, where now you've completely lost where you are.
- **Aero Peak through the Task Switcher**. It was a long time coming, but Windows Vista finally added the ability to click on an application from the Alt+Tab switcher. The problem Windows 7 added was full-screen Aero Peek to the switcher. If i tab, tab, tab to the window i want, while accidentally moving the mouse a pixel or two, the mouse hover will show me the application i'm hovering over. It will be the application i want, let go of Alt+Tab, but that's not the application i get.
- **Aurora**: Windows Vista had a whole energy visual theme. Explorer and applications had an "Aurora Borealis" theme; signifying energy and power. Windows 7 became flatter, more plain, boring. (Windows 8 took plain, flat, ugly and boring to new levels. And Windows 10 looks like it's c. 1985).


In my mind Windows 7 only added two features:

- a taller taskbar (a visible feature)
- [improved legacy GDI rendering](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff729480%28VS.85%29.aspx#gdi_rendering_in_windows_7)

The new taskbar in Windows 7 is **great**. 

But a Windows XP user, moving to Windows 7, doesn't realize that most of the features they are seeing were all introduced with Windows Vista. 

Windows 7 is not any *"faster"* than Vista. But it was so different, so maligned, that people jumped onto the next OS; without ever having seen Vista. And really all they hated was the painful transition of being forced to run as a standard user (UAC). My god did they hate having to run as a standard user.

Now it's not even an issue. In 2008 people were ***losing their minds***.>But if the whole world wants to live in the west so badly

There's the fault in training. 

- The whole world doesn't want to live in the USA. 
- Not even whole countries want to live in the USA.
- Not even everyone in Syria want to live in the USA.
- 80% of the population of Syria like their leader, it's the 7 million refugees who are fleeing war and death who want out
- the 7 million refugees don't even want to live in the USA, they want to live in their homes without dying

Just because 0.22% of Canadians want to live in the United States, doesn't mean Canada should be invaded. (It means you should let them).

Finally, just because you conquer Zambia doesn't mean they'll be added to the continental United States. The open borders, single market, and continues infrastructure means people in the continental United States reap huge economic benefits. Those benefits would not be realized if you annexed a country but did not move the country to the continental United States.
And a bit of history, for people who never knew:

> For many years Internet Explorer 6 was the very best web browser on the planet. And continued to be the best web browser the world had ever seen for many years. Everyone thinks IE6 is the worst thing anyone has ever seen. It was the best. It was absolutely the best. You should have seen Netscape 4, man that was a piece of work. IE survived, Netscape didn't, for good reasons. Microsoft deserved to have won that battle. But now we're stuck with it.

- republicans are happy because nobody's here illegally and laws are being enforced
- democrats are happy because immigration has been reformed
- immigrants are happy because they get to come here

It's a win-win-win.

Unless of course it's not the law the conservatives care about; they just don't like immigrants.I'm not sure what this guy is complaining about; but he seems quite grumpy about it....and the income continues past retirement.TIL people didn't know that.

Watching Hotmail come and go, i guess i remember such things.

And AltaVista. 

And NCSA Mosiac.

And Netscape Navigator.

And Microsoft's Internet Explorer 1.0Kinda. But something more interactive; live. 

With websockets, and gps, and maps.If only there were some way for people in Italy to reach a web site where people who have a car car can get matched up with people who need a ride.

If only these services existed online.

And a thread from today:

- https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/64bcee/remember_when_tom_wheeler_was_protested_at_his/

Reddit has no clue what it's talking about. Today people hate Tom Wheeler again because they don't understand things.

I'm not going to comment there to remind them of things - because it's neverending and exhausting.i knew the reason; i was giving him an idea for a video!Paging /u/WendoverProductions! 

Why do flight delays take so long to catch up?There was a BBC documentary: [**Frontline Medicine: Survival**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017ld83) that, among other things, showed the Medical Emergency Response Team (MERT).

A Chinook is fitting as a flying ambulance. An entire helicopter, staffed with doctors and nurses, ready to go at a moment's notice; ready to fly into the battlefield in order to pickup the wounded, and start treating them as quickly as possible.

It's such a righteous thing to be doing; it brings a tear to my eye.[Transparent Alumium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_oxynitride)Ok, that's as crazy left wing as Fox news is right wing. Come back to rational reality. 

Seventy people died a horrible excruciating death, and the Cheeto stuck them with [a proportional response](https://youtu.be/Xqx_vVbvkck?t=1m41s).

Don't substitute testosterone for foreign policy. And don't confuse trying to prevent genocide with warmongering. And don't confuse *wag the dog* with reality.[Yes i do](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/joey-heels-facebook-post-1.3577885)Look at Mr. Moneybags over here with his maid.I'm not going to arbitrarily hate everything the Cheeto does simply because he did it. I'm able to think for myself here.

- he's keeping Obamacare (it's good that he realised his original position was wrong)
- he's going to try to help prevent genocide (it's good that he realized that his original position was wrong)
- he's not trying to put Hillary in prison (it's good that he realized that his original position was wrong)

Go through his long long of amazing great things he was going to do *"on day one"* that he didn't do.  Hopefully, as he educates himself he will understand that all his positions are wrong.

On ***every*** other issue, Donald Trump is an idiot.

Welcome to Tannan.People praise Apple when they value security over the FBI investigating a terrorist attack. That's because Apple is *"sticking it to the man"*.

But when they value security that inconveniences the general population: people go insane.

Think god you hunted it down for me. It would have taken me forever to find the old Reddit threads from three years ago when this issue was first beaten to death.

This morning I was quite content to give up and let people rant in ignorance.I looked at [his website](http://grrrgraphics.com/uploads/7/4/7/3/74734153/russian-bear-obama-ben-garrison_2_orig.jpg). There's no way around it: Ben Garrison is a kooky nut-bird.
