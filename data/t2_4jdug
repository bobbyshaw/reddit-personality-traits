PG13 discord. Can't be having any inappropriate content on there!Aww, no love for Ascension? That's my favourite one so far!I'm confused to how they're selling unlimited drive storage. As far as I was concerned only universities and such were granted unlimited storage. This has got to be against Google's terms of service - I just don't understand how they, and similar sellers, can sell such large amounts of space for so little.Huh.Huh, is the exit IP you're using in the same country you signed up to PayPal with?I'm wondering if an "anonymising proxy" incorporates VPNs too - or just proxies.Yes I'm aware of that.Because I'd rather not switch the VPN off every time I want to use PayPal. Ah, I've heard of Stripe and some of the others before. Only issue is that PayPal is accepted basically everywhere and these other services aren't.That would be ideal, unfortunately PayPal's ubiquity means it's hard to *not* use it.Take a look at this: https://www.paypal.com/ie/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full#9

9.1.j - "Use an anonymising proxy;"Yeah, I was thinking I could just add all of PayPal's DNSes to the list of exceptions and it should work fine. My bank allows the use of VPNs but may not be happy if it sees me connecting from an IP outside the country.I heard you can add exceptions to certain sites in OpenVPN. Could I just do this with PayPal?All of the services you listed support torrenting and have OpenVPN protocols and will therefore work on mobile. As far as price vs performance goes I've been doing research since I ended up with the same 4 as I'm looking for one too and I decided for what BlackVPN offers it was too expensive. 

I was heavily considering NordVPN since it has such a wide range of servers and exits, however, apparently it doesn't have the best of speeds. I don't have the sources to hand but there were a few posts about it on reddit.

This left AirVPN and AzireVPN. I am still stuck between the two here but I'm tempted by AirVPN's extensive and featured website along with the fact they offer an open source client - but I'm a bit off-put by the fact they have stats publicly displayed on how much bandwidth is being used on each server and the top 100 users sorted by connection time, speed and bandwidth used. Of course this is all anonymous unless you specifically opt-in to show your username, but still concerns me that this is publicly visible and the paranoid voice inside of me is telling me that it could somehow be used to identify you. This is why I'm stuck between this and AzireVPN which also looks very tempting and has similar prices to AirVPN albeit a less featured site and I haven't heard anything on the speed of their service.

Don't take my advice as it is, do some digging around on reddit and various forums and see if you can find any other information that may sway you to one or the other.

Hope this helps!That sounds like a pretty decent idea. I might buy another SSD just for Linux and have my current SSD for Windows.AMD FX-8320 and an AMD Radeon R9 270.Argh, that requires having another, separate machine though. It would work through VNC though, right? That'd be quite ideal, actually. Do you have any ideas for what VM software to use. Oracle's VirtualBox springs to mind but apparently VMware's Workstation has much better performance.I'll look into it, completely forgot about Wine actually.Yeah I've blocked pretty much all the known ones - but using some fancy wireshark stuff from my Raspberry Pi - some contact is still made to Microsoft's servers. Terrorists are known for plotting attacks on WhatsApp, aren't they?Every time a gif like that is on the front-page the amount of creepy, inappropriate or downright racist comments are insane. It kinda saddens me quite frankly.`"Telling Steam not to update this app for 900 seconds"`Thanks for the reply!Lovely drawing! What did you draw this in?I'm slightly dumbfounded by the fact that plugging the power cable into a different extension cable has fixed the issue so far. It hasn't happened since.I've RMA'd this monitor and the exact same thing is happening. The chances of it being something internal in the monitor are very low.Unfortunately, I don't have a motherboard with a video output.Yeah I noted that in my description of the problem. I've tried using HDMI and DVI cables. Both confirmed working.I actually have a computer with a Celeron 420, it's a single-core 1.6 GHz CPU and it's absolute shit. Computer's running Vista too, as if it couldn't get any worse.The only spare monitor I have is a 1280x1024 Samtron monitor that only works half the time at 1024x768 if I'm lucky :/I believe the 3450 uses an older version of AMD's drivers: Catalyst Control Center, if you remember that... Ugh. The only other monitor I have is a 1280x1024 Samtron monitor with VGA input only - and it's pretty fucked, only works half the time at 1024x768. I could try that somehow, yet to work out how I'm going to do this though. Thanks for the help!No error message, nothing. Nothing to the effect of "The driver has stopped working and recovered" like it does sometimes in Windows. I can't use an iGPU because I unfortunately do not have an iGPU - I do have a spare old Radeon HD 3450, but it's pretty terrible and I think that has some issues with it if I remember, but I'm not sure.Being retarded is my specialty.Fuck it, I'm too paranoid and I'm going to send it back anyway. This along with the fact after an unexpected shutdown a few weeks ago I lost 400 GB of data without any real explanation.Train to Busan. The thought of a apocalyptic scenario like it is in the film with only 2 survivors, and all the atrocities they went through, left over from the train and almost get shot down by the military who assume they are infected. I couldn't just stop thinking about the facial expressions of the characters at the end and such. Hit me hard.I've tried SpeedFan, CrystalDiskInfo and Data Lifeguard and they all report the same thing.Interestingly my drive doesn't have 187 & 188. I does have the other 3 though. Unless they're called something different on WD drives.

EDIT: Also is "write error rate" a corrected write error, I can't find any documentation on this.Is the C8 (write error rate) something common to happen when the computer is shutdown while writing to the disk? Is it worth replacing the drive anyway?I did actually have a backup, albeit 2 weeks old which is not too good - but better than nothing! It would've been a big issue though losing this data altogether. Catastrophic almost.Alright. So in your opinion do you think I should be concerned about this increase in the write error rate value?Ah no I didn't mean the driver crashing having an effect. I meant the downloading of a file while the computer was shutdown unexpectedly causing an increase in write error rate.I knew someone'd say that. In all fairness I think 6 GB is a larg**er** not necessarily *large*, but *larger*.Yeah - says it's all good. I wrote some [context](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/5ynb3a/is_write_error_rate_a_sign_of_impending_doom_or/dere4q4/) on what happened in another comment.*Context:* I was torrenting a larger file (~6 GB) and I got bored so I decide to go on reddit and look at some quality OC, I click on a gfycat and my graphics driver has a heart attack and my display is just showing epilepsy-inducing flashing and horizontal black lines. This has happened before clicking on a gfycat so I wasn't surprised. I pressed CTRL+ALT+DEL and nothing happened so I came to the conclusion I was going to have to shutdown the computer with force. I held down the power button for 6 seconds and the fans spun down and it all went silent. No problem, I thought, I'll just turn it back on and all will be good. I turn it back on and log into Windows, do a quick chkdsk as I do after a shutdown like that - all good. I start up HD Tune and I check the health tab on my 3 drives connect: SSD? Good. Programs and Games HDD? Good. Drive with all my music, videos, documents etc.? Got a write error. 

A torrent was downloading to said drive when I turned it off so I assume that might've caused it.

**EDIT:** This is a WD Blue 1TBOh no, sorry. I can see why you misinterpreted that. I meant I don't have a peephole on my door.I don't even have one ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯That's incredible, I saw it and had no idea what it was for.Holy shit that sub is incredibleGuysThank you for the helpful reply, would some high-density foam do the trick do you reckon?That's a good point, I have it sitting on the floor right now; it is slightly raised off the floor by the small stands on the bottom of the case.Another good one: DRIVE Radio - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQA95v0kYvNnw80GBb7ZwhAMakes no difference to music playback, just looks pretty disgusting quite honestly. That's all.Ah right.I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/5wyliw/why_is_my_uploaddownload_speed_to_backblaze_b2_so/def1x3c/).Using the -threads xx parameter? Yes. My bandwidth itself appears to be limited.200 down/12 up. I get about 6 up in reality to backblaze. Talking in Megabits.> Amazon Cloud Drive

£55 a year, that's pretty good. It's basically like buying a 1TB WD Blue, except with no worry of it failing! I might look into this.200 GB maximum right now. Though that's likely to increase over time. It'd like to think it's unlike I'd have to restore from said backup, but knowing my luck...Ah alright. What's a less expensive solution in the long run for backing up/archival of just general shit? Backblaze Personal Backup? Google Drive?Do you think it's possible it's damaged just from a loss of power?The windows disk repair utility automatically attempts repairs afterwards and it reported they had all been done successfully. But that clearly wasn't the case as per my issue right now. :/The fact it lost power unexpectedly, that can't be good for it.I'll do that tomorrow. I'm assuming that surface test is similar to the error check in HD tune pro?I'm worried more now about if the drive is damagedFile size is showing as zero and nothing happens. Hash checks reveal the CRC-32's as 00000000, however MD5 and SHA-1 sums are still present albeit probably incorrect.Important, I suppose not. Irreplaceable, yes. I'm scared the drive(s) are also damaged mechanically too.It finished repairing them and they still will not open.I know that feeling...Pfft. Lucky you! Can't wait to get mine though!Woah, what shipping did you choose and what country was it being shipped to? UK here, not going to be another week *at least* until I get mine.The source (either uncompressed or 320 kbps MP3 format) sound perfectly OK. Any audio file which I encode in AAC 160 kbps (yes I understand that's an awful bitrate) has a horrible hissing sound artifact on higher frequencies like "S" sounds and such. Only remedied by using 320 kbps, but even then it's still noticable. This doesn't happen on MP3 files encoded at the same bitrate. Is this because of the encoder I'm using (presumably the one from K-Lite) or something?Any audio file which I encode in AAC 160 kbps (yes I understand that's an awful bitrate) has a horrible hissing sound artifact on higher frequencies like "S" sounds and such.

The song in particular?Aww, I wanted to know too. :(Says it's password protected. Not sure what's up there.What settings in particular?Thanks. :\^)This'd be a great addition, please consider this Dev team!Am getting the same issue.+1 for Gummy's Loveless!You can tell the guy sitting in front of the computer has a really wide grin on his face.Ah, thanks very much!Interesting, OK, thank you.+1, would also like to know this OP!Yeah that's what I was thinking - I love those two colours and they go really well together. As long as I have the money and I have somewhere to buy them from I'm deffo going to get the EnjoyPBT ones ASAP.Very nice! It was either going to be the EnjoyPBT ones or the Hangul layout from WASD.Yeah, next time I just so happen to have 100 USD lying around I'm going to try and find the Hangul versions of them because I *really* want those. Oh my god that looks so good! I love it! I've wanted a set of these keycaps or similar for ages but they're so expensive.Woah, is this getting deployed on airlines?That looks really cool, looks like a dream job to me! AOA and programming - two of my favourite things!Eh, I'd like to think my friends could trust me not to do that. I make specific efforts to talk about people as if they were there and definitely wouldn't say stuff about them behind their backs. You could try this: https://csgo-demos-manager.com/Alright, sounds good to me.Oh I thought that was ground/earth pin.Let's hope that is the case then!Yeah, I guess. But electronically, if there are 5 pins/contacts, one of which is positive and one negative, then if you flip it over by accident then you'd be reversing the polarities which is VERY bad for batteries apparently.
