That looks almost identical to the Huawei P10  
  
Edit: [hands on video](https://youtu.be/K6LlyHd63nk)I still don't like their OS design, I'm not a stock android fanboy but it's just not to my tasteThey call that copperSame hereTime to invest in Yandex stocksBest Korea only has one obese citizenGood luck dude! You better not damage my no-claims bonus on my bamboozle insuranceI have depression too, my advice is to do what you would do without the depression even if it's hard. It's absolutely fine to go without a romantic relationship if that's what makes you happiest but don't let depression block you if you would prefer a relationship.  
  
I have a couple of friends who have had severe depression at one stage of their life who were able to find love later on.  
  
You don't have to make a lifelong decision yet, you can give up on it for the moment and search again later if that's what you need at the moment :)At the moment yes, but there are some basic changes you can make that would improve your chances. (Before anyone gets angry about using the fitness cures all meme, read the last paragraph)  
  
I hope you don't mind me saying this but to be brutally honest the slight pudge and lack of shoulder muscle indicates that some exercise might help. You don't need a lot and if motivation is an issue you don't even need a gym membership or equipment, there are some good apps and websites about home workouts that don't​ take long but would make a positive impact.  
  
You definitely have positive sides, your teeth are in better condition than a lot of people's, your hair is good and I think over a  year or two your bone structure in the face will become clearer giving a more pronounced jaw line.  
  
I'd say that it wouldn't take much to give yourself a chance. I know this sub hates exercise suggestions but in this circumstance I think that it's the best option for visual improvement.  
  
Good luck dude!I started taking working out seriously just last week :)  there are some good apps about exercises that you can do at home without gym equipment if motivation is an issue (caynex home workout and Fitness 22 cover most of what I needed to know). Looks wise I'm exactly the same or worse, my chin is quite far back giving me a weak jawline and I have a Chelsea Peretti nose.  
  
This is hard to hide but I'm aiming to get more stylish clothes (avoiding neutral colours) and a better haircut.  
  
Personally I believe that my personality is shit too but luckily behaviour is one of the easiest things to change. Good luck, I'm sure you'll find someone eventuallyCongrats!Shit, I'm Kim Jong Ildon't quote me on this but this needs more jpegWhat's with the scam link in the imgur album?

UK: 116 123Please don't, seriously I was in your place at your age (guessing your age from other comments) and things really have​ got better. I know it's rough right now but if you battle through this I promise there are positive changes that can be made in life.  
  
With age can come a sense of purpose and more reasons to get up in the morning, school was genuinely the worst time in my life and leaving helped put a lot into perspectiveDude you're being way to harsh on yourself, the likelihood of you being that terrible personality and looks wise is extremely low.  
  
I'd wager that you being capable of this level of self criticism makes your personality better at the very least. Don't let what you heard bring you down, there are steps you can take to improve your appearance :)Or invest on r/memeEconomyWell yesterday I was depressed and miserable but I turned it around

It tells you every brand to avoid and their link to TrumpAn Easter island post on Easter :)I'm exactly the same, where I am I have so few chances to meet anyone even if there were willing to look past my big flawsThanks for saying this, I'm in the same situation as op and needed to hear thatI'm l glad you posted this, I came here looking for some reassurance that I'm not alone in this. Thank youAah cheersCan someone eli5 the difference between Mediatek and other processors? Some people confuse 'free of food' with 'free food'r/pyrotechnics ?I don't get the point of campaign flags after the electionU can fukin w8 4 me m8, kangawaitAnyone else know for almost certain that they will be single forever?Truely inspirationalYeah this joke bombed ages ago, repeating it so much really blew itIt's the same on the UK model, still 6.0I inherited it from my grandfather, he stole it from the Nazis in 1942Same, I have no social life no matter how hard I try and my chances of ever meeting someone who can see past my looks and health issues are slimAlso, Spicer compared Assad to Hitler so the Hitler version of this image applies to this administration nowYeah the title is pure clickbait, there's no mention of an upcoming (non-cyber) war in the article and no source that backs up the suggestion of an upcoming warDamn dude, I'm really sorry that you're having to handle all of this at the moment. I can completely relate to that sense of embarrassment you talked about but I would like to assure you that people won't be looking at your life as critically or as in-depth as you are.  
  
It might comfort you to know that more 18 to 34 year olds in the US live with their parents than their partners. You shouldn't​ put too much pressure on yourself to get everything sorted at once because you have a whole lifetime for that.  
  
About work; it's okay to be part-timing in the position you are in, it would be way too much to expect more than that whilst you balance everything else in your life at the moment. I've had a lot of troubles with employment too.  
  
I think it would do you a world of good to take some of the pressure off in life by either going full time education then work after or vise-versa, it would give you the time to start working on phobias and catching up with people.  
  
Take care dude, you can get through this!The fact that you're still going into college whilst feeling like that is an accomplishment. Don't compare yourself to other people because if their lives were identical to yours they would have made the same choices.  
  
You're working on your education at the moment which puts you a large step above everyone who has dropped out and you have a good chance of an enjoyable future.  
  
Don't panic about how well you're​ doing, you have options and control over your life no matter how things go. I'm in the same situation at the moment, we'll get through :)
The lenovo P2 has an SD 625 and a 5100mah battery, that could last daysExactly, their phones are great but there are plenty of competitors that keep the 3.5mm jack and are just as goodMy galaxy S6 is still amazing other than the battery, the S7 is very similar but with a reasonable battery so I think that could easily last me 3-4 yearsr/battlecarsAnd a floor made from JengaThere are too many good Android phone companies for me to buy a Samsung one againYeah HTC need to up their game, I see no benefit of this over the phones you listed and the Moto GNSA here, we're more interested in your porn tbh**Specs TL;DR**:

Launched in Russia, no word yet on available countries  It's an ABC article quoting Reuters as a source, both are pretty trustworthy> However, they said there was concern that any sign of actual preparations for a possible crisis would boost public anxiety.  
  
Looking at this comment section their concern is justifiedChina and NK have shared common enemies in the past as well as China benefitting from military and economic relations.  
  
They also have a [treaty together  that doesn't expire until 2021](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-North_Korean_Mutual_Aid_and_Cooperation_Friendship_Treaty?wprov=sfla1)   That's really interesting, I kind of assumed that the 'deep state' was something that conspiracy theorists were sticking with for ages.

https://i.imgur.com/uX6Rgv6.jpgI'm just going to comment this shameless plug for r/ActiveMeasuresI don't really get how any Christians can approve to Trump from a religious perspective. He's gone against many core Christian values.Woo! That's awesome to hear, thank youHaha I think I'll need a miracle at this pointAny word on performance improvements?

Alternatively the Oneplus 3T runs stock android too and the reviews love it.Not yetGet one of those cardboard ones you slot your phone into, they work greatThanks, I'll check​ it outWell now I don't know who to believe lol, I guess it partly comes down to what you believe makes god 'god'.  
  
I'll make sure to get better informed on the topic when I get the chanceI'm probably not informed enough to answer tbh, I've never tried a phone on a network that doesn't sell that model of phone beforeFair enough, I don't know enough about the topic to dispute that.
