Hmm... so assuming I maxed out my HSA family contribution this year (I didn't, apparently because I forgot to adjust the withholding ಠ_ಠ), and my employer contributes a flat $500, then W-2 box 12 should report $6750 for code W, not $6250?I have a question about **HSA contributions**

There are three kinds of contributions:

1. Contributions from the individual's bank account
2. Contributions *deducted* from employee's pay
3. Contributions *granted* by employer (i.e., that the employee would not get paid if he had picked a non-HDHP insurance plan)

Which of these count as "employer contributions", and where do these different amounts get reported?

I see type 2 reported on my W-2, box 12 code W.

I *thought* that types #1 and #2 should go in Form 8889, box 2, and that type #3 should go in Form 8889, box 9. But H&R Block's software thinks that only type #1 goes in box 2, type #2 goes in box 9, and type #3 apparently goes nowhere.

What's correct?Even if MARTA *had* built more parking, assholes like you would have just complained that they wasted money on empty lots.Yep, he is ***LITERALLY A CRIMINAL***./r/darknetplan

https://docs.meshwith.me/> Clear Winslow must be in a quandary about her dui and 3peat of using taxpayer money for her campaign. What a shitbird. 

You should watch the video. She starts telling a story about going to a park into her district and telling some potheads sitting on the playground equipment that it's not nice to smoke around kids, then somehow spins it so she ends up talking about violent drug dealers shooting children. It would be impressive if it weren't so fallacious.

What she fails to realize, however, is that if drugs were legal than dangerous drug dealers *wouldn't exist* because people would just buy their weed from convenience stores.They voted to refer the ordinance back to the public safety committee, where it will (presumably) appear on the agenda at the next meeting on April 25^^\(I ^^think) .I know, but some of the pics are old.So, here's what's going on (as of 5:58 PM): **Ivory Lee Young**, **Keisha Lance Bottoms** and **Yolanda Adrean** are arguing that the law should not be approved today because police forces within Atlanta (including APD) could still charge people under the *state* law, which would remain draconian. They want to hold the legislation until they can negotiate with Mayor Reed and APD to make sure that officers only charge people under city ordinance, not state law.

[Here's the trouble: Mayor Reed's administration had ***plenty of time*** to get on the same page with City Council on this matter already. What's *really* happening is that ***Mayor Reed is stonewalling*** as a tactic to kill the decriminalization effort entirely.]

**Andre Dickens** is trying to amend it to have a delay before it goes into effect, so that it can still be passed now, while giving Mayor Reed a *limited* amount of time to negotiate.

6:00 PM Edit: audience chanted "vote today", **Joyce Sheperd** called them "disrespectful" and **Caesar Mitchell** agreed

6:05 PM Edit: **Joyce Sheperd** is talking about how drug laws need to be addressed on a national level instead. She's trying to make the perfect the enemy of the good.

6:08 PM Edit: Joyce Sheperd is now talking about how the issue should go to the NPUs, or maybe a referendum.

[FYI: Atlanta Planning Advisory Board, the umbrella organization that coordinates between NPUs, *would* have considered the issue at its meeting on Saturday but did not have a quorum.]

6:13 PM Edit: **Felicia Moore** still wants to pass the ordinance today.

6:20 PM Edit: Ivory Lee Young is asking about state penalties again; solicitor is asking for more time to answer. Ivory Lee Young is not supportive of sending to NPUs or passing it with October delayed effect. Young: "We are not in the business of telling our police officers 'don't enforce the law'" He argues that officers would have discretion to arbitrarily choose which law to charge with.

6:25 PM Edit: **Cleta Winslow** is in a quandry; she says her constituents are "talking out of both sides of their mouths" by telling her both "lower the penalty" and "go after the drug dealers." She makes a moralistic argument about how kids shouldn't have to smell marijuana when they go to the park.

[Cleta Winslow doesn't understand cause and effect: she's arguing that people smoking marijuana in public somehow puts children in danger by conflating it with drug dealing, failing to realize that the danger is caused **by the illegality**, not by the drug itself.]

6:30 PM Edit: **Michael Julian Bond** is "conflicted" and not prepared to vote on this today. He is now describing history of which jurisdiction handled which sorts of charges and why. TL:DR: he thinks that only 4 out of 2827 cases go to city court because everyone else had multiple charges.

6:38 PM Edit: Michael Julian Bond thinks $75 is too low, ticket too lenient as a maximum penalty. He is sympathetic about low-income people who are charged, but apparently not wealthier people. [i.e., he fundamentally does not believe that drug use should not become legal, and thinks there needs to be "balance" with the desires of people who are upset about drug dealers in their neighborhood, making no distinction between marijuana dealers and dealers of other drugs.]

[murmuring in the background; audience doesn't like what he's saying]

6:40 PM Edit: Michael Julian Bond wants to refer to committee

**Keisha Lance Bottoms**: "we don't have the authority to tell APD to send to local court because they take oath to uphold state law." "I am concerned that we are sending false expectations that you will not get arrested for possession when we can't control that."

6:45 PM Edit: **Kwanza Hall**: added amendment that ordinance would become effective July 2017, still wants to vote today. Says points raised by other councilmembers are "not germane" to this local issue.

Ceaser Mitchell says there is a substitute motion on the floor to refer to committee. [I don't think council ever actually voted to make that substitution.] Now says Kwanza Hall is asking for indulgence to substitute ordinance and vote up or down. Now they are discussing the substitute motion to refer.

6:55 PM Edit: **C.T. Martin** sees no need to rush, and talks about how college PDs can use this law in a way that might differ in spirit from what city council intends. Wants to refer to committee.

6:57 PM Edit: Howard Shook calls the question. [After waiting a long time for stragglers] vote passes.

6:58 PM Edit: ***Vote to refer to Public Safety Committee passes. 10 yays, 4 nays.***

7:00 PM Edit: Andre Dickens makes Freudian slip, ["accidentally"] accuses rest of Council for wanting to maintain criminalization with discriminatory enforcement before being corrected. He reminds rest of council to quit stalling and come prepared to next committee work session.

Caesar Mitchell: I recommend that four things need to be accomplished within next two weeks:

1. make sure everyone, including adminstration, provides all necessary data to make decision

2. Real and robust conversation with chief of police to understand how APD would handle it if enacted.

3. Do whatever necessary conversations need to occur with other agencies (other jurisdictions, other PDs, other courts)

4. Strong communications and education plan.

Keisha Lance Bottoms:

1. Requesting law department produce non-legalese memo explaining how to correctly accomplish what they're trying to do.

2. Requesting list of all of the offenses for which someone can be arrested in the city of Atlanta (as opposed to offenses where only a ticket, not an arrest, is an option)

7:05 PM Edit: C.T. Martin: saw document re: "bridge thing" laying out what each city department needs to do procedurally; wants similar document for this. Wants SOP (standard operating procedure) from police chief.

Micheal Julian Bond:

1. Find out if we can bifurcate the charge between recreational use and medical use

2. Find about the city's power for retaining cases from the county (state)

C.T. Martin asked for something else, but I didn't catch what it was.

7:10 PM Edit: meeting moved on to next issue.

(Note: I don't know all the councilmembers by sight and the overlay graphics are wrong, so my transcript might attribute statements to the wrong councilmember.)[Atlanta City Council livestream](http://www.atlantaga.gov/index.aspx?page=567)

Public comment is happening now; watch citizens demand decriminalization and see if the council listens.

(Not all comments are on that issue, some are about Turner Field redevelopment etc.)Good luck with that. You might want to take MARTA from Indian Creek tomorrow.Vote for transit?LOL, rektIndeed:

* Transit begets density. ^^\(unless ^^the ^^government ^^fucks ^^up ^^the ^^zoning)
* Road capacity begets sprawl.I know you're sarcastic, but some things shouldn't even be joked about!"Police say" it was caused by a gas leak. Maybe they're correct, but I'd wait to hear the engineers confirm it.That applies in the City of Atlanta. Dekalb, non-Atlanta Fulton and Clayton have not yet chosen to hold MARTA additional funding referendums.

(Joke's on them; these failures are mostly screwing over people outside the city limits anyway.)The I-85 collapse is south of the GA 400 merge, so the latter is affected too.

Clearly, this is all a conspiracy to get people to move to the south and west sides of town. ^\sThis doesn't screw over the City of Atlanta; it screws over Dekalb County.

And it's entirely the state's fault, not the local government's. Dekalb has no control over the freeway system.Yes, but only in the sense that home and commercial have different real estate costs and per-watt costs. For example, a residential system on a roof (that wouldn't be used for anything else anyway) could be said to have $0 real estate costs, but the panels would cost more because they wouldn't be bought in bulk and because, with a fixed installation, they'd lose some efficiency. In contrast, a large commercial solar power plant takes up space that can't be used for much else, but the panels (bought in bulk) can be installed on sun-trackers and be as efficient as possible.

The bottom line is that anyone interested in owning solar should do the math to compare the ROI of installing their own panels on their own property or buying stock in a solar power utility, and do whichever is higher.> (the reason they always had a consumer goods deficit, they were always in catch-up mode, as opposed by the US which had barely been touched)

I don't buy it. That might have been a valid reason for a few years after WWII, but it doesn't explain why the shortages persisted.Who says you need a high-paying job to do that? Sure, it helps, but you can always adjust the timeline or your expenses in FIRE to better fit your income.

Not to mention, there's plenty of high-paying jobs for non-geniuses. (Probably more than there are for geniuses, even! At least in my anecdotal experience.)And conversely, most people who can get a high-paying job are not geniuses.It's not "easy," it's just conceptually simple.

The reasons everybody doesn't do it is are:

1. [Hedonic adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) and lack of willpower.

2. Income *so* low that maintaining the required savings rate (which, for a 10-year path to retirement, is about 65%) would require their budget to be unreasonably low even by frugal standards (e.g. well below the poverty line).https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ai+music+composer&t=ffhp&ia=web> It's also possible that aggressive socialist and pro-union rhetoric would have alienated the white suburban vote that Hillary did pretty well in. Who knows?

With the blue-collar union types on board, I don't think Sanders would have needed nearly as much white suburban support as Hillary did.They should put up a permanent Mountain View exhibit in one of the sections of the tunnel between the concourses.http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/264/200/acb.jpg...says the guy whose flair says "practically Grant Park" instead of "Chosewood Park."

[Presentation giving overview, history, and future potential (PDF)](http://www.savetheoldatlantaprisonfarm.org/s/Save-The-Old-Atlanta-Prison-Farm-Presentation.pdf)> As you've pointed out in Wickard v. Filburn those powers are immense and practically immeasurable. The ACA is a great example of that overreach.

And a particularly exact one at that, since *Wickard* is the justification for the individual mandate, and the ACA probably made more people learn about that case than anything else in the last few decades. That's the funny thing about Obamacare: it's useful, but unconstitutional. With laws like that, it's always *really* tempting for politicians to say "eh, it's just a 'little' overreach; what's the worst that could happen?"

(Incidentally, I think plain old 'socialized medicine' or 'medicare for all' would be at least a little *less* constitutionally-dubious than the ACA individual mandate, as it would rely on the general welfare clause instead of the interstate commerce clause -- although to be safe, an amendment would still be best. Otherwise, an "HSA-on-steroids" tax-credit based plan is the least-unjustifiable healthcare plan I can think of right now. I'd be fine with either solution.)

> Where I am confused is in your own indecisiveness. You believe the court ruled correctly with regard to abortion and incorrectly with regard to civil asset forfeiture. Others believe exactly the opposite. Besides the Supreme Court, or Congress or the states changing the Constitution, who decides something is unconstitutional?

*ME!* 

(Ain't nothin' indecisive about that...!)

> By what standard can we measure accurately?

You can measure by your own standard. I'm just trying to persuade you (and everyone who might read this) that your standard should more closely match mine.

I'm not so naive as to deny that all this stuff eventually turns into politics and "might makes right" if you deconstruct it enough, after all!

> Just an observation. We've gone from a country with an understanding of the constitution, the limits on federal power, and an amendment process for changing it. It's become too hard to change it, so we just make laws (ACA is an example). Then, it became too hard to make laws the President liked, so we got line item veto and signing statements. Then, finally, we've found even those are too hard so we have Executive Orders. Immigration reform is an example of how that all played out. And, since we don't even go to the trouble to make laws, we have to watch EOs change everytime we get a new President. And that's the true monarch presidential situation.

Exactly. What people don't realize is that when they support popular laws that erode Constitutional protections (like the ACA, or the New Deal program that prompted *Wickard* in the first place), they *also* enable terrible laws (like the Controlled Substances Act) due to that erosion. "Slippery slope" is often accused of being a weak argument, but it isn't in this case because we can *see* the slide by looking at history. And even if they're not interested in evaluating laws on a Constitutional basis and prefer [appealing to consequences](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/26/Appeal_to_Consequences) instead, they should *at least* consider the effects holistically. As a simplified example, if better healthcare comes at the cost of destroying communities trying to persecute drug users... is it really worth it?> I've been around long enough to know that there probably aren't that many drug dealers slinging on street corners that have 810 credit scores.

Fair enough. (But, circling back to the original subject of the thread: if that's the case, how'd they buy a Hummer?)

By the way, I don't think having a good credit score is nearly as much of a burden as you think it would be, both because I think there exist alternative [but legal!] ways to raise money (and, let's face it, the minorities we're talking about here are used to being locked out of the mainstream banking system, even for unjust reasons), and because there ought to exist business models that don't require huge amounts of startup capital anyway (at least, not unless the "regulations" are *really* draconian). I don't plan to argue that point, though.> my point was as you well know there is no way the government is going to legalize it without allowing themselves to have their cut of it. it may not be ideal but let's be realistic that is how it will be.

Your cynicism may be realistic, but it is also self-defeating. Why preemptively surrender an issue when it is possible -- however unlikely -- not to lose?

Either way, it isn't going to stop me from continuing to advocate for liberty.That applies to most unions here, sure, but *police* unions are an exception. What you're forgetting is that they are, by definition, monopolies -- each jurisdiction has exactly one police department. (Jurisdictions may overlap, but that's beside the point.) The consequences of that are both that workers need more protection from management (no other employer to jump ship to) and that management has fewer tools to resist the union (no scabs to hire to replace demand-making workers). That makes the police union powerful, even in a right-to-work state.

(Ditto with teachers' unions, by the way.)>  Quite clearly, until something is declared unconstitutional it is constitutional. How do we know this? Because if we ignore the law we will suffer the penalties of the law. 

***Absolutely not!*** In fact, you have that *exactly backwards!*

Specifically, when you say "something" you're referring to "a law": "until a law is declared unconstitutional it is constitutional." This is not true. A better definition of "something" in this context would be "a limitation on government": "until a limitation on government is declared unconstitutional it is constitutional." (Kinda shoehorning in the symmetry there, but you can see what I mean.)

Read the US Constitution, especially Article 1, Section 8; the 9^th Amendment, the 10^th Amendment; and the 14^th Amendment, Section 1. Also pay attention to the *form* of the language in the Bill of Rights generally.

* In Article 1, Section 8, you'll see that Congress is given only a specifically-enumerated, limited set of powers.

* In the Bill of Rights, you'll see that they are mostly written as *negative* rights: "Congress shall make no law," "X right shall not be violated," etc. That is, they are not are not "granted" by the Constitution, but rather are assumed to exist as natural rights. What the text actually does is reiterate that the Federal government *does not have the power* to infringe upon them.

* In the 9^th Amendment you'll see a reminder that the previous Amendments were not a complete list, which basically means that *all* other negative rights should also be assumed to exist, and the Federal government doesn't have the power to infringe upon them, either.

* The 10^th Amendment reiterates "yes, we *really did* mean for Article 1, Section 8 to be a complete and exhaustive list"

* The 14^th Amendment applies the Bill of Rights to the States.

Everything about the plain language of the Constitution *screams* that the Federal government is supposed to be weak, limited, and pretty much always *assumed* to be wrong and tyrannical unless there's damn good evidence to the contrary. The only reason it is so large and powerful today is that the Interstate Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause have been stretched *so far* beyond recognition that the SCOTUS decisions involving them read like Orwellian doublespeak or something from Bizarro World.

> And the biggie, we failed to learn from prohibition. The war on drugs predates the 18th Amendment (prohibition of alcohol) by 5 years, but when we abolished prohibition we failed to learn all those lessons and abandon the war on drugs. This is an epic fail and I think you and I agree.

See, and there's a perfect example: the other epic fail was the notion that drugs could somehow be prohibited using a mere federal law (i.e., the Controlled Substance Act) even though alcohol, being no different, required a constitutional amendment.

(In case you don't know, the claim is that it's justified by the Interstate Commerce Clause, as interpreted by *Wickard v. Filburn*. That court decision declared that essentially *every economic act* -- literally including growing *your own* food on *your own* land for *your own* consumption without involving any third party at all -- was somehow within the definition of "interstate commerce.")

> Where do you stand on Roe v Wade? Is it constitutional? All the choice people say yes. All the anti-abortionists say no.

Sigh... yet another example of how "all the X people" fail to understand the Constitution.

Does anything in the Constitution give Congress the right to restrict a doctor from providing medical care? No. Does anything in the Constitution allow Congress to interfere in a person's right to decide what to do with his or her body? No. Does the 14^th Amendment prohibit state law from doing those things either? Yep. Therefore, abortion is legal -- done. Simple! The *only possible* way to rule that the other way would be if the fetus were a separate person, which (a) is a medical question, not a legal one, and (b) is more or less the distinction *Roe v. Wade* makes anyway. The main mistake made in the ruling was butting in with the "third trimester" legal heuristic when the determination of when the fetus became a person should have just been left completely up to the OBGYN.

*Nothing* in the analysis requires any consideration of the questions "is abortion right or wrong" or "can regulating it have good effects?" Those are simply *irrelevant*. The *only* consideration is "does the government have the power to interfere with the thing it is attempting to regulate?"Celebrities that live in or near Atlanta (at least part-time) include:

* Chris Tucker

* Tyler Perry

* Elton John

* Little Richard

* Jane Fonda

* RuPaul

* Alton Brown

* Jeff Foxworthy

* Evander Holyfield

* Kenan Thompson

* *way* too many R&B, rap and hip-hop musicians to list individually

etc.

Also, keep in mind that even aside from the recent surge in movie production, Atlanta has always been the headquarters of Turner Broadcasting System. That means a large fraction of the shows on CNN, HLN, TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, TruTV, etc. were produced here.Although most of the other reasons you've been given are true, the *main* reason the United Airlines incident got so much more attention is that it was exceptional (for occurring on an airplane, because of the policy of a private company), while the sort of police brutality this thread is about is disgustingly common and routine.> If being videoed is the only clear evidence that works

> that works

*Occasionally.*See, that's already fucked up. If you're a police officer, you should still get *arrested* and charged just as quickly as a non-cop would be under the same circumstances and according to the same standard of probable cause.

Nothing about the suspect (officer) being in jail or out on bail would stop the department from doing their "internal investigation," in the same way that any normal person getting arrested doesn't stop their employer from doing an HR investigation.

The decision to fire an employee and the decision to charge a suspect with a crime should simply be entirely unrelated.LOL. The police in Georgia totally have unions. [Here's one](http://www.gachiefs.com/).

Source: am Atlantan.> Um, civil asset forfeiture is the tactic of denying the enemy access to resources.

No. civil asset forfeiture is the tactic of denying citizens access to their property. Citizens are not, and *cannot be, by definition,* "the enemy."

> Someone said that the practice was illegal, it isn't,

No, it's unconstitutional. SCOTUS might have erroneously failed to recognize that fact, but it is still just as true as Dred Scott's citizenship.

> if you're going to wage a war

That conditional statement is *false,* because this was a discussion of a thing that is not a valid war.
>  Before we go any further, let's go ahead establish that when it is one day legalized, it will still legally have to be bought through stores, licensed sellers, etc.

No, let's not, because I reject the validity of that argument.

You're continuing to make the authoritarian presumption that the government "grants" people the right to do things -- i.e., that everything not specifically made legal is inherently illegal. This is *exactly backwards*: people inherently have the right to do things., by virtue of merely being human. The people grant the government the power to enforce laws, but everything the people do not specifically decide to make illegal is inherently legal.

If drug legalization came with regulation, it is only because the people made a decision to end the illegality of drugs -- full stop -- and *then* made another, *separate* decision to add the regulations back. That decision cannot be somehow "presumed" to be valid; it must be consciously *justifed*.

> If you think legalization will allow anyone and everyone to just sell it ok the street or person to person, youre delusional.

No, I'm just "idealistic," or possibly "unreasonable" in the George Bernard Shaw sense:

>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.Ok, fine then. But in that case, why are you talking about beagles and dogs in a discussion about cats?> Criminal acts against them? Are you talking about drug dealers shooting each other? Jeez you're messed up in the head. 

What's messed up about that? Do you think that if someone commits even a minor crime that they are somehow subhuman and no longer have any rights at all? You don't care about the fact that the "punishment" imposed by the other criminal is both extrajudicial and potentially excessive?

If so, then it would go a long way to explaining your position, since that's how authoritarian sociopaths see the world. But if that's the case, then *you* would be the one "messed up in the head," not me.

> And yeah I'm going to wager the guy who thanks the influences of music and video glorifying certain lifestyles, dropped out of high school at 14 and has a credit score of none, and gun felonies and no money saved, is going to get able to secure a bank loan and capital from investors to convert his illegal dealing business into a brick and mortar store.

Ah, dehumanizing someone based on superficial, bigoted assumptions about his "lifestyle." Well, I guess that answers the previous question!

You know *why* your imagined drug dealer glorifies "certain lifestyles?" *Why* he dropped out of high school? *Why* he has no access to credit? It's because his entire community has been taught, over and over again for generations, that even if they *did* try to succeed within "legitimate" society they'd just be targeted as "uppity," have racists take all their accomplishments from them, and maybe even get a literal beat-down -- despite having done nothing whatsoever wrong -- from your predecessors. "Fuck the police" is an attitude that is directly *caused* by institutionalized racism. And now, when you as a police officer in 2017, think things like "who cares about that guy who got murdered, he was a thug anyway," ***you're perpetuating it!!!***>  You're so bent out of shape by THINKING I liked the war on drugs, that you've rejected a side argument not on its own merits but because you're butt-hurt. 

1. No, I'm not. I have no problem with your opinion on what concrete actions to take about drug prohibition; I'm just disputing the validity of conceptualizing it as a "war." 
2. That is an ad-hominem attack, not an argument.
3. The argument I made also applies equally to things like the "War on Terror" or the "War on Poverty." Since I have no idea *what* your position is on those topics, your accusation cannot possibly be true.

The point I'm trying to make is that for something to be good public policy, it not only needs to have a good result, but it also needs to be logically sound and ethically justified. The politician proposing it has to be able to explain *why* it makes sense starting from first principles, e.g. in the way the Federalist Papers justified the Constitution.

The "War on Drugs" is bad public policy for reasons that go beyond the mere fact that it doesn't work. The public *should have* recognized that it didn't make sense and rejected it from the start. But they didn't, because normal people don't stop to consider whether the conceptual framework on which they are basing their decision is itself valid. That is a problem in and of itself, which is why I've written this series of replies!

TL;DR: It's important not just to make the right decision, but to do so for the right reasons.Sure they could! But since judges and prosecutors are willing to put up with their idiocy even at the cost of doing their jobs poorly and breaking their oaths, why would the politicians be motivated to change?

If the entire judicial system went on strike until public defenders had adequate manpower, *then* we'd see the politicians scrambling to fix the funding.Jeez, you're still going out of your way to rationalize creating criminals to prosecute. You are *assuming* that just because drug dealers are violent criminals now that they would continue to be, even though legalization would remove 100% of the reason for the criminality and the violence. It's as absurd as saying that anyone who holds a *yard sale* must be a violent criminal just because they can "compete" without being "licensed" "retail!"

The thing you're missing is that people are (or at least, are supposed to be) free to do pretty much whatever they want *by default*, and government restrictions on actions or requirements to get government "permission" before doing them, should only ever be well-justified exceptions.

Instead, you're advocating a situation where it is assumed that government somehow "deserves" to control all behaviors by default (kind of like a Soviet-style command economy) and that anyone unwilling to submit to that control should be punished. It's authoritarian, it's anti-American, and *should be* considered a violation of the 9^th and 10^th Amendments (but currently isn't because SCOTUS fucked up in *Wickard v. Filburn*).

----

Now, I'm *not* saying that it's "never" acceptable to impose regulation or licensing. For example, it's reasonable to regulate pharmaceutical manufacturers to make sure that their production process meets safety standards in order to protect workers and adjacent property owners, and that their product meets quality standards in order to protect customers. But even then, the latter restriction is only reasonable because consumers can't evaluate the quality of a pill themselves the way they can evaluate e.g. produce at the farmer's market. (Incidentally, when I say "pharmaceutical manufacturers," I am not making any particular distinction between large ones like Bayer and small ones like meth labs.)

Marijuana is different: since it can simply be grown like any other plant and can be sold unprocessed, there is no safety or consumer-protection justification for regulation and therefore it should not be regulated. It should be no more illegal to sell your neighbor marijuana from your home garden than it is to sell your neighbor tomatoes from your home garden. Of course, if you're making pot brownies or something (at a scale/frequency larger than an occasional charity bake sale) then it's reasonable for you to be subject to the same requirements as any other prepared-food manufacturer (i.e., the same as if you were making non-pot brownies for commercial sale). But that's because making prepared foods inherently raises safety issues such as cleanliness of equipment, etc., *not* because the use of some particular ingredient somehow justifies extra scrutiny.A "legitimate journalist" is indistinguishable from a citizen.What does "you *will* be, unless [you cooperate]" mean as an answer to that question? Is an incredulous look and a "no, seriously, am I free to go or not?" a sufficiently-respectful follow-up response?You wrote:

> I think there is confusion between a general tactic of war and the morality of a particular war. The tactic is sound. If you're going to wage war, be it over oil, the pacific, to stop terrorism, or to fight drugs, denying the enemy access to resources is logical. My point wasn't to say that the war on drugs is just, it was just to address the logic of the tactic.

The issue is that the tactic is *not* sound, because "waging war" on an idea is fundamentally nonsensical. The "enemy" is non-corporeal and its "resources" are memes. 

More concretely, with the "war on drugs" we're *not* talking about a war against an organized army of drug dealers that will surrender if you destroy enough of them. We're talking about a war on the economic circumstances surrounding drug use, where the act of attack itself *causes* the enemy it aims to defeat. The illegality of drugs creates the black market, the black market creates the high profits, and the high profits cause people to form gangs to better capture the market. All the police accomplish by taking out one drug dealer is to decrease supply, which drives up price, which causes another drug dealer to take the first one's place. Conceptually, "waging war" is simply a futile, wrongheaded approach to the problem.So what? SCOTUS upheld *Dred Scott v. Sandford*, *Plessy v. Ferguson*, *Korematsu v. United States* and a bunch of other wrong decisions, too.> They're enforcing current laws

> I know the system is broken

I think you -- and the rest of the judges and trial lawyers in this country -- need to reconsider how you reconcile those two statements.> Got it

No, I don't think you do.

The violence only exists in the first place because they can't use the law to solve their disputes, because if they tried to report the criminal acts perpetrated against them, you'd just arrest them for the drug dealing instead of treating them as victims.

If it weren't for the drug persecution, they'd be able to protect their "prime location" by simply *buying it*, opening a store, and getting the state to enforce their property rights just like how it works for any other normal citizen! After all, you don't see the local 7-11 having a turf war with the QuikTrip, do you?>  I am 1000% pro legalization.

Well then you should have said that the first time!

>  Sorry I didnt specific for you sir In​ detail that I meant not narcotics but the violence that comes from illicit sales and organized crime violence. 

The problem with your statement was not that it was insufficiently specific, it's that it was *categorically different.* It's an issue of accuracy, not precision.

If that *really is* how you feel, then I don't know if you've been spinning your words to toe the official police "tough on crime" line for so long that you don't realize that you're doing it anymore, or if you just don't care about how misleading your previous words were. But either way, you didn't say before what you're saying now, so you might want to be more accurate next time.

> I believe it should be legalized, and to force the legal purchase, those selling illegally should be punished twice as hard as they are now.

...That statement doesn't make any sense. It's impossible for an action to be legal and illegal at the same time, so the person doing the action has no control over what category it falls into. It is neither necessary, nor possible, to punish people for selling a product that's legal to sell, illegally. Even if that were somehow a thing that could happen, there's no reason anyone would want to do it.

I guess you could be talking about regulations or something, but in that case the offense would be something different entirely, like "failure to maintain a business license."> I think there is confusion between a general tactic of war and the morality of a particular war. The tactic is sound. If you're going to wage war, be it over oil, the pacific, to stop terrorism, or to fight drugs, denying the enemy access to resources is logical. 

I think there's confusion between the idea of wars against political entities, and "wars" against ideas and behaviors. You can *win* a war against a country by forcing its government to recognize your victory, but there *is no such thing* as victory over an idea.

At least not unless you're willing to create a *1984*-style totalitarian dystopia, anyway. (And despite Orwell's cynicism, I'm not convinced it's possible even then.)... then it should be no problem for the prosecutor to prove it.That might be persuasive, except for the fact that I've never used weed (or been arrested, for that matter).>  Now I feel safe. 

LOL, you fucking coward.To some extent, sure.

But it was [this](http://donotforgetourhistory.weebly.com/uploads/2/5/2/3/25236385/8164530_orig.jpg), too.> Why do people assume every case of civil forfeiture is false or with fake charges... 

Because the entire country was *founded* on the principle that everything the government does should be assumed to be tyrannical until proven otherwise./u/Drano365: a retard not realizing that "illegal" and "wrong" aren't always the same thing.> What isn't Savage now? Jesus Christ 

Well, except for that time he flipped over the merchants' tables at the temple. But what's that got to do with this thread?>  If this was taken from a guy who's part of organized crime/gang related drug trade, fuck that guy and I'm glad he got his ride taken. 

"Organized crime/gang related drug trade" only *exists in the first place* because of the drugs' illegality!

Without the unconstitutional laws, nobody would put up with the black market; instead they'd just go up the street to the damn pharmacist!There's a difference between "items proven to be proceeds of the crime" and "everything the defendant owns."Seizing *evidence* that is *actually related* to the crime is one thing. Seizing *all* the defendant's assets regardless of how tenuous their connection to the crime might be is another. In the latter case, they're not only imposing punishment before conviction, but they're also interfering with the defendant's ability to afford a lawyer.> a businessman who can show that he had legitimate income to make such purchases vs a guy who never filed a tax return in his life and has 20k in cash

Wait, which one was Trump again?> Exceptions being when the crime means you lose the right to own that property (e.g. guns). 

Even that is unjust. Taking the weapon itself is fine, but taking the *value* of it should not be. Instead, it should be handled more like eminent domain.It's *both.*

All that's left is for somebody to try quartering troops in people's houses and then I'll have a "Destroying the Bill of Rights" bingo!

It's a shitty game to win, though.> If you're going to wage a war, however, denying the enemy its resources is a logical step in winning.

There *is no* "logical step in winning," because the war on drugs is *unwinnable.*You know how you *really* make drug crime "not worth it?" You make the drug dealers compete with Walgreens and 7/11, sucking all the profit out of it.> Hell, a disproportionate number of them will be in jail at some stage anyway.

Quoted for insight.> Then you probably live in some hippy area where drugs haven't ravaged both the community and made day to day life shitty for cops. Probably some hippy Utopia like Berkeley/San Francisco or the northwestern​ states like Oregon or Washington. 

The drugs didn't ravage the community, **you and the other police did**. Here's a clue: the thing that all those "hippy utopias" have in common is that they *quit trying to persecute drug users!*

Cause and effect. Learn it!> Rest assured every LEO wishes drugs ceased to exist overnight

And there's the logic fail and strawman argument all rolled into one.

Drugs will never, *ever* cease to exist. Therefore, the *only* way to end the war on drugs is *legalization*.

In other words, you were *pretending* to agree while subtly misrepresenting ending the "war on drugs" with ending "the existence of drugs." You only want the war to end if you "win" it, but since you damn well know that's impossible, your platitude is a damn *lie!*

> My field training officer was shot in the chest and another LEO shot in the pelvis in the same incident over narcotics

Bullshit! It wasn't over "narcotics," it was over **the illegality of** narcotics. If the situation were the same but the drugs were legal, then interacting with the person possessing them would have been no more dangerous than talking to a pharmacist.Cutting their work to *less* than half, you mean. Persecuting stoners is low-hanging fruit compared to solving crimes that actually matter (property crimes and violent crimes).> So, they both make less than minimum wage and, according to /u/hsjskeichrneic, enough to afford expensive cars in small towns?

3 officers, and the *entire rest of the force* enabling and abetting them.Covering for a corrupt cop **is itself** corruption.What he's saying is that under your scenario -- forfeiture only after a conviction -- that would be criminal forfeiture, not civil.

Unless you're suggesting that, just because someone was convicted of a crime, you'd be okay with assets being seized without the police having to prove they were related to the crime itself? (E.g., if the defendant had a small amount of drugs and a large amount of cash, but there was no evidence that the cash had been obtained in exchange for drugs or that it was going to be exchanged for drugs, you'd be okay with the cash being seized anyway?)

If that were the case, then the other reply would stop sounding like a strawman argument and more like some surprisingly accurate reading between the lines.> The fact that they are understaffed doesn't make them a shitty public defender.

Perhaps not, but the fact that they are understaffed *does* mean that it's a horribly broken system, and that everyone who aids and abets it -- including prosecutors like you -- is evil for doing so.

And before you say it, I'm not buying the bullshit excuse that the politicians are the ones in charge of the budget so that makes it not your fault. If judges and prosecutors actually cared about justice, they would refuse to try or prosecute cases in which the public defender clearly didn't have enough time to mount a competent defense -- or even simply go on strike.So what are the HOA meetings like?Congratulations! (or maybe "?" in this case)

You're one of today's [lucky 10,000](https://www.xkcd.com/1053/).I agree that it's *necessary* for small countries in a way that it is not for the US, but I don't see how that logically implies that it wouldn't work here.

There may be reasons unrelated to country size that would make it not work, of course, such as the sentiment /u/ATE_SPOKE_BEE expressed (and which I am not unsympathetic to, by the way). I'm pretty sure there's no way this idea would ever get seriously considered by the public and/or government, but it's an interesting thought experiment.

I do think it would be helpful in a few ways, though:

* It would make people less likely to treat soldiers with either insufficient sympathy or excessive deference.

* People would probably still fight about gun control, but their opinions would be more informed.

* Everyone would have a vested interest in having a deeper and more nuanced understanding of foreign affairs.

* It might help the sorts of people who join street gangs find legitimate occupations instead. (Or it might train better criminals, but my wild guess is that the former effect would be larger.)

* If it were implemented well -- i.e., if MOSs and assignments were determined only by aptitude/merit and having wealth or power couldn't get you special treatment (such as exemption, entering as an officer instead of enlisted, or priority choice of branch) -- then it might help make society more egalitarian.It's true. My parents' relationship is pretty egalitarian, but my wife has a domineering dad and a submissive mom. It's tough to figure out how to *help* my wife stop deferring to me so much without *making* her stop and thus perpetuating the issue instead of solving it.> 3 years 3 months 1 week and 3 days

Is it terrible of me to wish she had waited (exactly) two more weeks?Nah. If we were going to do something like that, we should instead take tips from the US Constitution and Federalist Papers by disbanding the standing Army. Then we should take tips from countries like Switzerland, Israel, or Taiwan, by organizing the unorganized militia (i.e., by making all adult citizens train in the reserves).The other part of the problem comes from fact that the group doing the discriminating *intentionally* uses the "overt" definition in order to minimize it, while the group being discriminated against *intentionally* uses the "institutionalized" definition in order to maximize it. It's less an issue of confusion, and more an issue that each side thinks the other is being disingenuous.> How can you have a meaningful dialogue about racism when nobody can actually define the term being discussed?

How can you have a meaningful argument about *anything* without defining the term being discussed?

In other words, you're correct, but the scope of your correctness goes beyond the issue of racism.> They hold close to a trillion dollars in US debt instruments, both directly and indirectly. Nowadays they use that as a Sword of Damocles over government policies. If they dumped that debt it would flood the bond markets and likely trigger an inflationary crisis.

Debt -- especially sovereign debt -- is just words; if the US wanted, it could simply declare the debt to be void and it would \**poof*\* out of existence.

The Saudi's real power comes from the fact that doing so could cause everybody else who owns US debt to lose confidence in the investment and stop buying more.I think that's actually an example of the problem, not of the solution. It's not the word "state" that's the issue.

First of all, the *real* "SAT words" here are the ones in the context: "inconstancy," "obstinacy," "consecrated," "corruptions," etc.

Second -- and more importantly -- unless the rest of the excerpt that you omitted makes it much more clear, the question being asked requires a pretty non-trivial background in western civics and/or political philosophy to answer. Think about it: if you ignore what you know about Enlightenment philosophy and the French and American Revolutions, why wouldn't it be just as plausible for the answer to be A or B? For all I know, there might be some non-Abrahamic religious text somewhere that says something similar, but uses "state' to refer to an individual's karmic state or whatever.

The point is, while it's true that anyone with a US public school education *should* have the background necessary to understand the context, it clearly has the potential to disadvantage (for example) immigrant students coming from countries without well-established democratic traditions. Why, after all, would a Somali refugee think talk about avoiding the evils of prejudice or corruption would be an argument to be applied to a political entity? And that's before even considering the issue that the kid might have ESOL-related issues.

It is sometimes even argued that the same sort of logic can apply to students born in the US, if they are from certain minorities. If you're a Native American kid who grew up on a reservation or a black kid growing up in the projects, it's at least *plausible* that your parents and/or larger community might, out of a sense of disenfranchisement, reject this sort of stuff as hypocritical and deemphasize teaching it. Or maybe they emphasize their own culture's traditions and language instead. (I'm not necessarily claiming that this happens; I'm just hypothesizing it as a plausible explanation.)

Third, at least [this article](http://www.alternet.org/story/13826/failing_the_test_of_fairness%3A_institutional_racism_and_the_sat/)  (which is clearly not impartial, but makes claims plausible enough not to be dismissed out-of-hand) asserts that there is a structural bias in the way the test is designed: 

> Essentially, the company’s position is that for any question to have "predictive validity" it should be answered correctly or incorrectly in rough proportion to the overall number of correct or incorrect answers given by test-takers. But since the general scores have tended to exhibit a racial gap, such logic results in the virtual guarantee of maintaining that gap, as a function of test development itself.

> If test questions were made less culturally biased, so that the racial gap shrank or disappeared in the pre-test phase, those questions would likely be thrown out, simply because, being less culturally biased, they failed to replicate the racial gaps produced by the rest of the exam.> Maybe, this kid, like you suggested, could be encouraged 'constructively solve' this problem instead of asking a higher authority (aka. teacher) for help.

No, by asking the teacher for *advice*.
