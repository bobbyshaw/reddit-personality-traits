> What advantage is there to being the opposition?  

Get those 'democracy' money grants from USA and EU? Play 'pocket opposition' role to establishment like LDPR in Russia? Put yourself and your team in the position of power so you would be beneficiary of this corruption? Look at Ukraine, for example, many Maidans - same shit, country is courrupt af and going downhill. Last one was a bit extreme and people had hope, but... nothing happens and on top of that Poroshenko was involved in Panama papers scandal (the same scandal that forced Iceland's PM to resign).  
&nbsp;  

Anyway, I really doubt that Russia is ready for actual democracy, vast majority of people just want a strong hand (nationalism is strong there, people always buying on exceptionalist rhetorics and power play in international politics) and economic prosperity. Putin is good with first, but not really - with second, so there's a little bit of controversy around him.
As their neighbor (also, KGB still exists in my homecountry, even in Russia it's FSB now) - nobody cares.  
Same with Nemtsov, who was shot near Kremlin recently.  
Politics is really unfamiliar and distant concept for your average citizen, he can't relate to victims and believe that they were representing his interests and weren't involved in some shady business. It's easier to assume that all of them (both government and opposition) are corrupt fucks and they're just eating eachother like spiders in a jar.  
Safe bet, tbhAs someone from Belarus: welcome to the club, it sucks to be us.> to completely regular Americans in suburban NJ  

well, not to Americans... but who cares> Your version of WWII must be fascinating and yes, the Nazis weren't Nazi enough, that was the problem.  

Basically he wants white man's version of ISIS. Do you find this surprising?Poker is this type of game where it's not working, your bets have to be valuable - otherwise all this bluff, agressive play, etc won't make sense.  
We got around with chocolate covered nuts, but you have to keep them supplied as they naturally come to end ;)There is lesser known unsuccessful attempt to launch Soyuz-18, called [Soyuz-18A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_7K-T_No.39). Spacecraft failed to orbit, and the crew (Vasili Lazarev, Oleg Makarov) experienced about 21g, or up to 26g according to telemetry, while basically falling from space in detached re-entry capsule.  
Really interesting story, there's a [short read](http://www.americaspace.com/2013/09/29/creeping-and-unpleasant-the-near-space-experience-of-soyuz-18a/) about it in English.Korolev himself has been in Gulag for 8 years because of false accusation.Surprisingly, they haven't claimed St. Petersburg.After that guy could start his own youtube channel, 'how to make money by being an asshole'

UPD: damn, its 114. My flawless theory...> Would being a Muslim from Chechnya make him less Russian?  

That's not how it works there.>  black trans people generally have no problem turning into the opposite gender.  

Really? I think he meant asianYou know, there was one national-socialist party...  
For any kind of bullshit (no matter how self-conflicting) there's a representing ideology or political movement.Ah, I was thinking about alcohol as in refilling your home bar. Yeah, socializing can be expensive in some places.I'm perfectly aware of that, but as we're speaking in this topic - we have Uzbek suspect that was denied, but wasn't deported. Norway doesn't have a problem deporting Uzbek nationals to Uzbekistan, why Sweden has?  
Anyway, most people fleeing to Europe are economic migrants, especially from Uzbekistan. Those people perfectly know that the country which they're fleeing to doesn't want them (because professional migration requirements are much higher), so they abuse the system of asulym, doing shit job for those that actually need it.  
I think that's where some work needs to be done. Maybe organising a fund of 'countries, that suffer from illegal immigration' and paying from it to country that is willing to review their asylum application would be it (some in South America or Africa would be not against it, I guess). Would be cheaper than all the processing and no sense for economic migrants to apply. Asylum should be not 'I want to Sweden', it should be 'I want somewhere safe'.   
I'm not usually 'that guy, who knows it better', but it seems like western governments don't have solutions on how to close the loopholes, so I just want to know why some obvious ones aren't working.As an immirgrant myself I'm having a problem with how getting in EU countries is a right (because that's what it is if they can't remove you after the application was denied) and not a privilege. Right to appeal is good when you have a legal status in the country, if not - you're nobody here, which means escort to detention center and first flight to the country where's your passport from. Have all the appeals you want in your local embassy.  
&nbsp;  

It's not about how it's working now, it's about to how to make it better for everyone. Healthy relationships will benefit both local and immigrant population.> Then I would take the guy's advice.  

Just because someone happened to be right doesn't mean that he wasn't talking from his ass (aka had rational basis and through analysis behind his position).  
There definetely were times when you haven't listened to someone's advice and saved money, think about those times :)If someone with six figures is wasting any significant percent of his income on alcohol, then he better be concerned about his health. Or he's too much into luxury (life isn't any worse without Hennessy Paradis or something with comparable price tag).  
What people often forget is that 'all into savings' life is a good way to get a depression. Of course, alcohol is not healthiest way to have fun, but it's up to him to decide.It's not about global market, it's about local market.  
Many local companies are able to sell something (and provide jobs, keep some money in the country, etc) only because imported goods are taxated and thus cost higher. EU is beneficial when your local companies are strong enough to compete for local market with foreign products and gain from access to global market, otherwise they will just die because there wouldn't be tax barrier for superior foreign goods.Poor states in EU remain poor, they just get stripped of manufactures (because they can't compete with EU goods) and talented/capable workforce is migrating to Western Europe.  
Idk why you have such a need to bring politics in it, with its current economics Ukraine will simply become donation state for EU.Hold my bear, I'm going in!AyyOn a different note, war became too distant and unfamiliar concept for the citizens of developed countries now (no draft, little losses, massive propaganda), there's almost nothing that stops politicians from deploying troops somewhere (as long as it's not another developed country which could fight back) because people simply don't care that much and are pretty used to see dead people on TV as statistics as long as it's somewhere far away in the country they don't care about. You know, the same kind of blind eye we turn to homeless people.  
&nbsp;  
Terrorism tears apart this distance, it brings war to your doorstep. So, some acts of violence could be explained. Not justified, but explained, as an attempt to hit the enemy where it hurts most - war was never ethical, just some of the losses are your people and you feel for them, and some are not.  
Also this is unrelated to ISIS, as they are pretty much death cult.You still won't get their browser history though.I'm not speaking about condolences, just some common empathy.  
Ironically, there's [little something](http://pikabu.ru/story/i_vsetaki_on_byil_v_chemto_prav_4081803) a bit lower to illustrate my point (got included into the feed because of the same tags "Терракт" and "Взрыв", but regarding Brussels attack). Some comments are trying to bring a bit of faith into humanity back, though.  
Anyway, comments on most Russian websites regarding attacks happening in EU are cancer mixture of smugness (because it's not them) and ~~stormfront~~ (okay, it's a bit too much) 4chan-level racism.Мои соболезнования (My condolences).  
Maybe at least this is enough to erase smug smirks on some faces and understand that we are together in this (just some experience reading comments in Russian regarding terrorist attacks in Europe. 'Business as usual' and all that).Bombs have plenty of metal elements for shrapnel, otherwise they wouldn't be that lethal.>  does something  

And what that would be?  
Get all chechens and dagestanis (russian citizens, btw) and put them to Gaswagen?  
Russia has plenty of Muslim population historically, and recent refugees are Ukrainian.> After 14 years, America has found no such weapon.   

Because that was complete and utter bullshit?I mean in our lifetime, in context of refugee crisis and all that.  
Anyway, at the moment there's not much countries with lax migration laws. Some from South America and Southeast Asia, maybe, but general trend is definetely not liberalization.> Of course they will be able to hold Chechnya, Russian armed forces are stronger than Chechnya.  

Now they have to pay in money, in your case - they have to pay in blood.  
Latter is not something that Russia needs now.> It's okay, because Chechens aren't warriors and unable to any regular warfare. It will be a slaughter of children.  

Go outside, find one and say it to his face.> why dont you just round them up and send to gulag?  

[History has infinite material for irony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardakh)
Refugee is a refugee, permanent stay applicant is a permanent stay applicant.  
For latter there are pretty high standards literally everywhere - you have to be ether high-paying professional (and have job offer with amount of money higher than countrys average salary), businessman (with requirements for investments or obligation to create jobs) or have experience in demanded fields. Migration isn't easy and never was.  
Refugee, on the other hand, skips all those requirements because humanitarian disaster happened in his country.It does bother me when people can't swim, do basic first aid, don't know how to operate a car when skidding and can't recognize when person next to them is having a stroke. Compared to those basic skills (which might save your life or someone else's) being awful at math is ok.  
Also math major.Not exactly. Just some neighborhoods, in some cities, in some states...  You know.  
Anyway it's something that simply should not be the case in the country with such amount of wealth - but still is.> What if the intruder has a gun?

Usually not a problem outside of 3rd world countries.  
Other than that - intruder might have helicopter as well. If we're speaking about safety, barricading entrances and calling the police is definetely safer than involving yourself into gunfight even if you are familiar with your weapon (which is not the case for most people, even from land of the free).  
Speaking purely of numbers, putting aside morality - I'm not sure that the time lost during self-defence case with a cold body would be be worth some petty shit that intruder might get from the part of my house while police is on the way.  

But some people just need that 'I'm a MAN' validation.> Trello for job searching

Other than that - looks userful, good job.You can get an axe or something.There are opinions of people who read about socialist state and those who experienced it.  
Very different opinions.ayy  
/r/me_irl> Part of its role for Russia is legitimizing: "they could go sell themselves to Europe and NATO like Baltics or Ukraine, but they're still with us"  

Lukashenko and Russia are much more compatible ideologically, since current Russian government doesn't really care about persecution of opposition, 23 years of presidency, etc.  
If Europe and NATO would be able to ignore what happens inside the country and basically just feed it with money (like Russia did) - they would gain an 'ally'. But Belarus doesn't have that much of a value in international politics.> Maybe they make huge party in occasion 100th anniversary of the October Revolution in this year...  

to add up the irony - this day is a national holiday in Belarus and I'm sure Lukashenko will give some speech regarding anniversary, he's pretty big fan of commie rhetoric and all that.Lately they started to pull 'Western influence' vector (protests came handy, whole show is like 'Look, we're almost having Maidan over here!'), but only because that can be used to milk some money from Russia.  
Yesterday's [assymetrical reaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61fc53/freedom_day_belarus_minsk/) on protests was exactly this.> Russia and Belarus are increasingly neutral towards each other which is highlighted by their media increasingly ignoring each other compared to how they portray, say, Ukraine.  

Lukashenko will do many things for money and recent cold rhetoric is only because Russia sort of raised prices on oil and natural gas and isn't providing Belarus with dotations anymore.  
I think only thing he won't do it's giving up sovereignty, as he was building the whole government system to revolve around him for 23 years, and judging by interviews - it's pleasing him to no limit, to have such a power and to be the top person in the country.  
But allowing Russian militiary to pass... why not.  
Or Europe has to offer him a better deal, that's also possible.Just offer some coins to the company, it's not like WhatsApp is opensource.keeping 'em safe from all those militant anarchists! /sThey don't give a fuck about the rest of the world.

Feels definetely better.upwork is a sweatshop.Ah, reflash.  
Don't remember it in much details, but in general you have to get your hands on production-signed firmware (and dev toolkit, then you should be able to reflash it over RS232) or upgrade package (if you have full access over sysmode). Basically, you need someone with the access around [here](http://www.verifonedevnet.com/verifone/devnet/dnProgramView.do?pageTypeId=109140&programPage=%2Fjsp%2Fdevnet%2Fprogram%2FdnDownloads.jsp&programId=483417&channelId=-9087), I guess - haven't seen this site back then when I was working there, but it looks like a resource for service staff, so it should have what's required to reset the device.  
[This](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/857725/Verifone-Mx-900-Series.html?page=31#manual) manual has some info about upgrading the system with packages, as for reflashing - maybe there's something available on DevNet.Moiraine, Tuon, Min..?Don't know, tbh, I did software engineering and our units weren't used as extensively as when they're in the field - so haven't noticed any troubles with wiping them up.Ah, Mx925! Was participating in development of Mx9 series like 5 years ago (worked for Verifone at the time), glad to see it here.  
Penguin isn't lying, there's linux inside ;)You sure you are the one who knows what he's talking about?  
Discussion was on specific phenomena of thug codex ('ponyatiya' and 'vorovskoi hod' in general) in Russian prisons. There were times when one had to earn the title '[thief in law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief_in_law)', for example, and there are the times when he can buy it (but it became really inflated and doesn't mean _that_ much now).  
I'm not sure who you are arguing with here.> Russian prisons have a thief law wich based on some sort of a justice betweet all prisoners. They even have their underground court.  

used to be before 2000s.  
This justice code had most meaning in early 20th century and during soviet era, when percent of political inmates and intelligent people in prison was quite high, which led to some sort of a functioning system with strong anti-establishment ideology basis.  
This attitude went down during and after 90s, when organized crime got possibities to actually integrate into society - laundry their money, start businesses, cooperate with corrupt law enforcement, etc. Some of high-ranked criminals literally became the government and were/are sitting in Duma.  
Of course, this 'codex' still works to some degree, but whole 'living by it' and brotherhood thing is mostly romance now.Actually, this whole topic is incredible.  
It will only get better in the US day time.  
EDIT: it got better.To keep military complex spinning, war must keep on going. Doesn't matter much where.  
It wouldn't hurt if there would be a little extra oil, though.Your 'source' tries to state that Assad tortured 150000, do you actually believe that?  
Syrian army put really high civilian death toll (around 140000) mainly because bombs and missles - the way they work when targeted on cities, you know.  
Civil war, what else could be said. Ukrainian army is doing the same, just on lesser scale.  
Torture estimations are around 5000 - still not pleasant number, although I'm really sure that Saudis did something similar (if not worse), but the US is still best buddies with them.  
It's really funny to see people arguing on who here has higher moral ground, especially given the history of meddling with ME and oil wars from certain country.somehow everytime as I'm reading those posts I'm replacing 'gf' with 'cat' and it's feeling more natural.

Switzerland, Germany to some degree (Munich specifically), Norway maybe - although not sure.as someone from Belarus - it's not really related to this sub, let me clarify.  
1. Belarus introduces visa-free travel (with 5 days of stay) for citizens of about 80 countries.  
2. Russia is mad since we ~~haven't asked for approval~~ are in union and don't have boder control - which means someone can enter through Belarus, overstay visa and get into Russia by car. So they introduced passport control on border and all that.  
3. Lots of talking from both sides - this article is one of the examples of such.That's why need revolution, comrade!> 23

> and unless you've got a lot of time under your belt speaking to people from minority groups in Russia, you can't possibly claim to have even a basic grasp.  

so did you?  
I'm half-black from neighboring country (lived there like 24 years), Russian native speaker, been in Russia multiple times and very familiar with their culture as well as with people - and don't see much issue with what OP post is about, besides some strange delivery manner.  
Russian society as a whole is chauvinistic and harsh on people with notable differences or flaws, they're easy to jump in 'us vs them' mentality - us vs gay people, us vs "churki" (slur about people from Kavkaz region, which is used by Russians casually), us vs the west (with some load of political bullshit from telescreen), etc, etc. But that's mainly the result of little interest and exposure to outside world, more educated Russans who travel a lot usually don't have such problems.  
Would be really interested to hear about those difficulties you're talking about./r/postnationalist is also pretty chill placeshitpostAlong with giving guns to literally everyone, right?To my perspective - it's much easier to be an illegal in the US.  
At least in Cali you can get drivers license without immigration status proof and after getting it - it would be sufficient ID in many-many cases, americans are not that attached to passport.  
In EU, hovewer, you need special ID card or passport, you can't get those without authorities checking your immigration status.> It's Always Sunny  

and never Shia :(As China gives a damn about emissionsAhh, of course those evil brown people provoked him, lurking around like that.> Most people who mug with a knife have it for intimidation and/or self-defence.  

Not speaking about that slicing people aint easy.  
To kill with a knife one has to deliberately go for it or go into affective/berserker state (happens with some people, that's how you get bodies with 40+ knife wounds), otherwise it's quite hard thing to do.  
With a gun - everything above + pull the trigger due to stressful situation and immediate 'oh shit, what I've done', leaves no other option other than putting second bullet, as attacker is already pretty fucked.TL;DR: typical older person with soviet background and cold war mentality.No.  
Belarussian economics is really bad, it will not benefit from EU trade and customs agreements. Such association will only lead to flight of skilled workers, which means country would reduce to shit even faster than with current approach.  
To actually benefit from EU economics needs to be strong before joining.> America is far more tolerant and inclusive.  

in terms "us vs them" - maybe, as in the us you can build a mob of any minority because country has literally everyone and thus feel a bit safer.  
In general - you got one of founders of motherfucking Breitbart in presidents administration, is that making you think or you need to wait up till 'Sieg Heil' in your face?There was no such thing as Euromaidan in 2012.  
In 2013, though, there was Right Sector with shitload of far-right and nazi ultras.If government starts to dictate specific way of living and act as moral authority then it's damn sure something is wrong with that. We seen all that shit in Soviet Union - ban of "freeloading", no-children tax... fuck that.  
Work is a possibility, not the obligation.Yes, if family has no children or children are older than 10.  
Sources are only in Russian, if you are familiar with it - I could list some.In theory. In practice it's a little bit more complicated than that.  
And anyway, why some housewife is suddently obliged to work and if she's not working - to pay money to Lukashenko?>  People who are registered at the employment center (which basically means that they try to find a job) don't pay this tax.  

try to ask someone who tried to do that lately.  
Because of flood of uneployed the centers are using all kinds of tricks to avoid registering them to not to fuck up official unemployment statistics. And that's besides all kinds of the odd jobs (общественные работы, нутыпонел) which you will need to do while registered.  
Registration as unemployed means someone actually has the intention to work - it obliges to visit employment center and go to interviews. Some people (housewives, for example) do not have that intention, so they will lose their unemployment status as fast as possible.  
This decree is a joke and spit in the face, it should be cancelled.Maybe just droned her, who knows.Having a [regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Battalion) full of neo-nazis doesn't really help to build a positive image, you know?My bet it's [Academeg](https://www.youtube.com/user/AcademeG), Russian youtuber/car reviewer.
