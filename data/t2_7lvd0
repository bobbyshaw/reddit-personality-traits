Granted, there's no reason whatsoever that these awesome games couldn't be made for the PC. It's entirely up to the developer, and comes across to me - at least - as an unnecessary kind of exclusivity just for the sake of corporate greed/loyalty. For all it has in good games, there is nothing about the PS3/4 that would preclude its library being playable on a PC.8143When people ask how concentrated I like my Kool-Aid."Give your money to the church to absolve yourself of sin! But you're still dammed to hell, anyway."

I think I'll just keep my money, then.TIL the black-dominated multi-billion-dollar rap/hip-hop music industry was just a figment of my imagination.I'd nearly put up actual money that the author would absolutely refuse to permit a separate relationship between their S.O. and another person if they're the one enjoying external relationships themselves. Almost completely invariably, every single couple I've seen who purports to enjoy an "open relationship" is comprised of a serial cheater who gets around like oxygen, and a very emotionally abused "partner" who pays most of the bills for them and has been cowed into supporting their abuser's behaviour because they think it's necessary as a political ideology. Not just among straight couples, either; I've seen it across all facets of the spectrum. I've seen gay couples where one defends the other, saying, "As long as he's happy, I'm happy". I've seen straight couples where the man gets around with multiple women, and an emotionally-devastated spouse stays with him just because they fear they won't be accepted by anyone else. Most commonly though, I see a woman who sleeps with whoever she wants, and ostensibly says her male partner is free to do the same, but knows deep down that while she can basically walk into a bar with a shirt that says "fuck me" and get at least one offer in ten minutes, he'll have a nearly impossible time attempting the same, and so while she espouses some sort of fairness in their mutual freedom, it's always an abusive, emotionally oppressive one-sided cycle.

Monogamy arose as we progressed beyond a society that revolved around the "alpha", wherein all members male and female were expected to bow to the sexual prowess of the most powerful individual. Breeding rights were reserved for the alpha, and the betas were treated with violence and sometimes death for attempting to partake beyond their station. As we became more compassionate and, dare I say it, *diverse*, we ceased worshipping the ape with the biggest dick and started to have meaningful relationships based on respect and mutual support, instead of just acquiring the strongest sperm. It makes me shudder to imagine folks advocating a return to that; a destruction of the emotional maturity we've achieved.No problem. I was just curious, and wondered if it was a glitch.Most likely due to public decency laws, advertising standards, and social practices in a lot of places where the product may be marketed. You'll note in the article that it said that several of the products used the correct terminology on the directions inside the box, while using the "sanitized" language on the publicly-facing surfaces of the packaging. Condoms - just to name something from the other side of the fence - also rarely outright use the word "penis" on the box, but will often include at least one mention in the enclosed directions. Even some sex toys my wife and I have bought don't ever make a mention of their function on the packaging. To be blunt with an example, we saw one recently that described itself as "textured toy balls" (anal beads).

In a lot of places, a product can be banned from sale or only made available "from behind the counter" for having "indecent" words printed on the packaging. When your company is all about the almighty dollar, you have to do everything in your power to convey why yours is the best genital-focused product without ever actually saying/printing words that might get it taken off store shelves. Same reason toilet paper never says "shit" or "poop" on the wrapper, despite its obvious uses. Maybe that's just an outdated cultural hangup, but I don't think it's malicious.

That all said, yes, they need better enclosed directions to be medically-descriptive and accurate. I had a friend in junior high who let it slip that she didn't like tampons because it hurt trying to put them into her urethra. If there's going to remain a social stigma against "dirty" words, then we at least need to make sure that the proper instructions come out in private, somehow, be it through enclosed directions or better education.Having had a friend go through the same, I know that it's an easy trap to fall into. The "desire to be desired" is one of the strongest pulls in the human mind, going all the way back to primal beings who felt self-actualized by wooing women away from rival breeding competitors (the "alpha"-based social structure). It's one of the most base pleasures to know "I was picked over this other guy/girl", and lots of people will throw all reason away just for that rush, even if it means that they're attracting the types of partners who will repeat the process and go to someone else the moment that they're the less-desirable option.Inverse is between me and my wife. If she has to work in the evening, I'll still offer to cook anyway, and put aside leftovers for when she gets home. She'll usually come home just wanting to go to sleep, but I tend to nag and badger her like a mother hen, insisting that she should eat something. We've never actually gotten into a fight because of it, but there have been a few times when she's had to tell me, "Just stop. I'm okay. I'm seriously not hungry."

It causes me a weird sort of emotional pain when she convinces me to cook just for myself. I feel like I'm being neglectful, even though it's on her say-so, specifically.The grass may be greener on your side of the fence sometimes, but it's never a bad idea to check the neighbor's in order to reaffirm that you know how to spot the green from the brown, in case it ever creeps back to your side.

I love - LOVE my video games, but that's just low.

Luxuries and consumer goods should be under the umbrella of a free market, while standard-of-living, safety/security, and medical products should have a socialist structure. 

Let the various companies compete over who can build a better smart phone or make a better-tasting potato chip, but keep corporations out of fields like health care and emergency response. We already know how dangerous it is to have a privatized fire/police department (see: mercenaries), so why do we roll those dice when it comes to something so fundamentally crucial to the continuance of humanity as public health is?

Edit: I imagine an awful future in which some new plague is ravaging humanity, and we don't even have the decency to distribute a cure without charging an arm and a leg for it.

"Slip-and-fall accident at work."

"Shame."You're close. A theory, in the scientific sense, is basically the conclusion drawn from a body of evidence. It can apply to things that are broader "concepts" than anything (like the Big Bang), or extremely granular, irrefutable situations (like earth gravity exerting 9.8m/s of acceleration in a vacuum).

Basically, a "theory" is a working model that explains the evidence. If your evidence is "objects fall to earth at 9.8m/s^2", then the theory of gravity is the umbrella that unifies this evidence with other similar evidence to product a mathematical/physical set that can be used to explain the same phenomena in different circumstances.Kings rule from thrones.

Gods rule from on high.Lots of debate about this, but I've got my own fan theory.

The first ghouls aren't really documented until just before the Great War. We know that the US government was also experimenting with FEV just before the war, as part of a super-soldier program. When FEV is directly administered, you either get horrifying accidents like Centaurs, or you get Super Mutants (closer to the super-soldier ideal). However, I wonder if perhaps they weren't terribly careful with their research, and if a light smattering of FEV possibly crept into the waterways and the jetstream. If so, the majority of the population may not have seen any serious effects, but those who were severely irradiated could see the virus suddenly mutate, resisting the worst radiation damage but still permitting the surface tissue degeneration associated with it (skin sloughing off/turning leathery). Where an ordinary person would die from ghoulification, an FEV victim may be "saved" by the virus.

That's my hypothesis, anyway, and fits both as an explanation for no WWII ghouls, and the "FEV explains everything" trope.

Edit: Fallout 3 was where a lot of the canon shifted, so I don't know if this is the best source, but from the wiki:

>According to ZAX 1.2, the FEV is a shifting-absorptive megavirus with a protein sheath reinforced by ionized hydrogen that **makes it immune to irradiation**.

This is in line with the ghouls we know and love.As an aspiring pencil-and-paper RPG designer, I owe huge props to FNV for the DT system. I played a lot of D&D with my friends, but all of us agreed that it was weird that the game's primary method of damage control was done by constantly missing (failing to overcome a target's AC). It was weird to imagine some monstrous enemy with loads of heavy armor, and yet you hurl an explosive jar at it and it gingerly avoids the attack entirely. A damage threshold seemed to make much more sense; an attack connected but failed to do damage because the armor absorbed all of the impact.

So, when I started to write a space horror themed RPG for my friends to play, I split the damage avoidance into the damage reduction of a player's armor, and their raw dexterity to potentially dodge the attack. Everybody agrees it plays much more realistically, and I have FNV to thank for the inspiration.It's easy to get sucked into. Not universally, but generally, there's a lot less pretense and self-importance on a lot of metal bands, compared with their pop/rock/rap contemporaries. For myself, I know that music aside, one of the most refreshing things about finding metal was that a lot of the bands took themselves less seriously; there weren't so many "divas" and the types whose names you expected to see before the words "...checks into rehab for the third time after drunk driving incident". Mostly though, this was just due to it being a less popular genre, with less money to be had, and therefore, less "superstars". But, plenty of attitudes there, which a prospective fan may dismiss in exchange for the novelty of finding new music.

When I first started listening to metal, I refused to listen to anything else, believing it to be "lesser". It was a good few years of pretentious assholery before I started warming up to other genres again, and took the blinders off to realize there were plenty of assholes in metal, too. I still prefer the genre, but listen to a wide variety of other stuff, and don't look down on other people who like other genres like I used to.

They got diluted in cause over time, and eventually closed down. But, like any professional troll effort, they spun off plenty of people calling themselves "meninists" who were just out to cause trouble.

Meninism isn't really a "thing" in terms of social activism, and doesn't represent the men's rights effort.I'll take it one further for you: I'm on the spectrum, and I'd rewrite my own mental chemistry if it meant I wouldn't have Asperger's syndrome anymore. The social anxiety and awkwardness that comes with it isn't "cute"; reflection on past screw-ups I've had actually nearly drove me to suicide several times before, just because of how emotionally painful and simply cringe-worthy it was to think about some of them.

I used to be teased endlessly for my strange mannerisms, even to the point of my own family members calling out "Retard! Retard!" whenever I exhibited this weird tic I have where I would fidget with my face while giggling under my breath. I was acutely aware of the behaviour, but couldn't stop it. Half of the times I've committed a social faux pas, it's like driving a car when the brakes suddenly fail on you: I've been completely cognizant of when I go "off the rails", but I can't seem to prevent the inevitable crash. That feeling of helplessness, and not knowing when I'm going to screw up yet another relationship by being "the weird guy", causes daily pain, and I've never felt comfortable ANYWHERE that I need to interact face-to-face with people. It's a wonder that I found a kind, sympathetic woman to eventually call my wife.

It's a painful existence, but I can't do anything except experience it, trapped in my own mind. If there was a pill I could take that would ensure every generation after me was guaranteed free of the illness, I'd take any amount short of a lethal dose.

Most frustrating thing to me is that I work at a high school with several transgender kids, and all of them, really honestly, just want to be themselves, not some weird public news story about who they used to be and all about how they got to where/what they are.

To boil it down to some really simple generalizations, this is about the easiest way I could illustrate the difference between the two:

>PUA: "I have a Ferrari, back in Italy where I live running charities for orphans. Want to hook up?"

>TRP: "I spent hours at the gym to get this physique, and recently edged out someone else for a top position at my company. Want to hook up?"

Both, it can be argued, treat sex as nothing more than a simple commodity exchanged between human beings, but the difference seems to be in the ethics of acquiring that commodity. Granted, you are always going to get the occasional PUA who DOES have a good job to boast about, or the occasional red-piller who unnecessarily embellishes their accomplishments, so I think that's the fuzzy line along which some people have difficulty telling the two apart.Yay, now maybe I can go see it!This actually reminds me of the recent round of upgrades my department started. Now, we probably have a lot more techs using Mac laptops than most, because we support schools which also have a Mac majority.

Couple months ago, they asked everyone in a meeting what kind of things they needed in a new computer, because some of our tech laptops were getting old and broken. Holy shit, did people get greedy.

>"Oh, I *totally* need it to be a fully-loaded 15" Retina MacBook Pro with 2 TB of storage."

>"Yeah, and the upgraded graphics card!

>"Well, just as long as we all get the fastest processor possible!"

...Etc. Everybody's "bare minimum" turned out to be a machine worth roughly $3200.

Meanwhile, I was sitting there incredulously flummoxed, wondering how on earth these guys could possibly need a massive high-definition display and maximized everything to do remote desktop support, email, and occasionally, SSH. They just wanted "new" for the sake of "new".

Unfortunately, management listened to them, assuming they knew their own needs best. But, like most IT departments, we don't have a huge budget. So, everybody was unpleasantly surprised when they revealed the timeline on which they'd all be getting the laptops they "needed": some are waiting up to five years before they'll receive their upgrade, based on when the money will be available.

I, on the other hand, spoke to my boss separately about my more humble/realistic needs and was one of the first people upgraded to a new machine: a humble but reliable 2015 MacBook Air. Thing's awesome to work on.

Just to cinch it all off in a concise manner, and using a less politically-charged term, think about a slang term like "cool". It's used so much in the common vernacular to mean "something good" that when you say "that's cool", it's far more likely now that you're saying "that's good" rather than "that has a low temperature". This is much more mundane in its impact, but an example of the same. Misuse a word enough, and it loses the impact of its meaning. This doesn't matter so much for something like "cool", but does matter for something more important to define, like "violence", "rape", or "racism".The U.K. one is particularly weird, because of the inflammatory nature of the tax titles used. In the UK, many goods and services are subjected to value added tax (VAT), which can go up to 20% in some cases. If I've got my second-hand story straight (a friend of mine lives in the U.K.), tampons used to be taxed under the broader VAT when it was higher, but were reclassified as a "luxury item" for a time, supposedly as a sort of loophole which allowed them to be taxed at the luxury tax rate, which was lower. I think most recently they were back under the general VAT umbrella, but it's easy to see how calling something hygienically essential a "luxury" pissed some people off, even if it was misguided.

Now that said, I think it's also weird how many places are on track to eradicate tax on tampons and pads, but not on other hygiene essentials like soap and toilet paper. I'd like to see a move to make these items exempt from taxation to make them more affordable for everyone, if even just a little.
