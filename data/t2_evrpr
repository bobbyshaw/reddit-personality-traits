> At any rate, I'm removing the ban.

Thank you.  That means a lot.  This is one of the examples that, combined with the examples shown from the right wing users of /r/Canada, shows me that this isn't a political agenda issue.  We've all jumped there first, because "This *has* to be because of their political leanings, because this application of the rules just doesn't make any sense".  But the evidence shows this poor moderation can be wildly aimed at anyone, regardless of political leanings.

The "antagonism" rule was created to prevent people from saying "Hey fuck you, you stupid asshole!" to each other.  I had a post deleted for "antagonism" when I told someone to go fuck themselves.  That was one of the rare instances where I thought "Oh, yeah, you're right, I fucked up, that *is* against the rules", swallowed my pride, and accepted it.  But this?

Saying "I think some trump supporters are racist" is "antagonism"?  I don't want that kind of discussion to be banned, any more than I want someone to be banned for saying "I think some Trudeau supporters are naÃ¯ve" or "I think some left wing people want white genocide".  I'd disagree with it, I'd debate it, but I sure as shit would not demand that it be removed.Oh it's very low, around 30C when this is happening.  And I'm running Speedfan, it's not even getting hot enough to crank up the fan.  And CPU load stays around 20% or lower.Like this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwyBZUdTgTM

It's definitely *possible*, just not worth it.http://i.imgur.com/2UVjsRq.gifvYeah, shit's gotten kinda fucked.  There's now a whole list of banned words that automod will automatically delete any post containing any of them.  I'm afraid to even question the mods on this sub without getting banned for "trolling" or "rabble rousing".  Ironically, this post was removed for "low effort".*This submission* you're posting in was removed.  I just tried.  Can't even use one of those words in any context, it's an **automod banned word list.**  As in your post will automatically get deleted if it **contains** one of those words.So if I say "Donald Trump is a cuck" my post won't get deleted by automod?  Automod now has a list of "banned words" and is deleting any post containing such words.  Even though I seem to recall you specifically asking the mods a few months ago if you could ban the word "alt-right", and them insisting against banning specific words.Was it you that made the changes to the rules on /r/canada and is deleting any discussion about it as "rabble rousing"?We do.  They get deported when their asylum claim isn't granted.  We just decided it's easier to do it that way than spend ourselves broke trying to enforce one of the world's largest land borders with the GDP of 30 million people.

But I'm sorry I interrupted the rage boner in this thread.I guess you might say they're naive cucks, then, if they're willing to bend over backwards and roll out the red carpet for corruption, nepotism, and cronyism just because he's the only one who yells about immigrants loudly enough.> We're the laughing stock of the world.

No, Rob Ford is dead.  Now it's America's turn to be the laughing stock of the world.How is that supposed to work?  "Oh yeah I know Donald Trump is a giant lying egomaniacal douchebag, but I'm worried about immigrants so fuck all that I'm voting for the crazy asshole"?Jesus fuck, talk about a trashy title.The UK is a little different.

> do cats have little organs in their bodies that just pump them full of LSD sometimes?

Fun fact:  Humans actually do have this organ.  It's called the Pineal Gland and it releases DMT, a powerful hallucinogen similar to LSD.  Its function is not known.  Some hypothesize it gets released during sleep, explaining why our dreams are so fucked up.Activia/Biobest is the one usually recommended by doctors dealing with Crohn's/IBS because it *does* contain probiotics and it's easily available at most supermarkets, but it's still on the low end in terms of culture count.

Everything I've read suggests Stonyfield Farms are the ones who make real yogurt, they even lobbied my province's government to make a minimum culture count before you're allowed to call your product "yogurt" since they don't think its fair that they're the only ones producing real probiotics.  Look for yogurts that list which strains of bacteria on them at the very least, the better ones will list their million/billion cultures per gram count as well.

http://pecanbread.com/healingcrow/ferfun/conspiracy/conspiracy.htmlAccording to the person, they manually dialed the number printed on the back of the credit card.  Now I've heard of spoofing caller ID numbers and even \*69 dialback numbers, but not taking over someone else's phone number.Dialing *out?*That stuff isn't yogurt, its pudding.  Half of these brands marketed on TV commercials for middle aged women don't even have any probiotic bacteria in them, and the ones that do they literally just *add* probiotic bacteria to pudding, and nowhere near the amount you would get with actual cultured yogurt.  The other ones just use skim milk powder, sugar, and whey for the protein. 

I mean there's nothing wrong with this stuff if you enjoy it as a snack, but it's frustrating seeing so many people buy the worst of it thinking it's healthy or good for their gut.  It'd be like if they made "whole wheat bread" where they took white bread and stuck one whole wheat grain on top.Yeah but it's entirely a management sim, not really "play baseball" sort of game.  Did you really not know that helicopters could autorotate gently down to the ground during an engine failure like a maple key, and thought that they'd just plummet like a rock?  Or did you just say that to get us to learn something?You've taken the controversial position that light sabers couldn't work because even if you did make them powerful enough to cut through metal and other materials using lasers or plasma, they'd just pass right through each other as well, not bounce off each other like swords.

Well sir, I posit to you, what if light sabers were plasma fields (like the kind used in a plasma cutting torch), suspended in mid air using superconducting magnets (which we all know can suspend things in mid air), but then two light sabers would *repel* each other using the [quantum lock](http://i.imgur.com/yARwIxR.gifv) force of superconducting magnets?

Do you recant your position on the impossibility of light sabers, or did I just string a bunch of complicated scientific concepts together that I don't really understand?For those unfamiliar, somehow smart meters got caught up in some kind of crazy conspiracy theories akin to chemtrails and JFK assassinations.  People have fired shotguns at power workers trying to install smart meters.  There are hundreds of Youtube videos about everything from them supposedly causing cancer, to them being used to spy on you.  And there are huge campaigns to get them removed or banned.

It's just such an *odd* thing for the conspiracy community to get fixated on.  Fucking digital power meters.Has Canada ever had a non-caucasian PM before?I knew this obscure poster on my bathroom door would be relevant some day!

And it has that sweet gesture pitching that I honestly think is the best way to simulate pitching in a game - the more accurately you do the gesture, the more accurate the pitch is.  The faster you do the gesture, the faster/harder break the pitch is.Oh sweet so it's just like MLB 2k12!

How do you get a hold of a scammer through the number on the back of your card?  A couple people here have offered plausible explanations - got 1 digit wrong and the scammer registered that number, or was using a land line and hung up and redialed so quick that it never disconnected.  I've also heard a theory about a femtocell outside the house, but that's a bit much.They do, but it's usually in cheques, and it's usually one of those "clears after the 3 day check, but then rejected after the 9 day check", and you spend that money in between day 3 and day 9, and then you're on the hook when the cheque bounces.  I'm not sure how it would work with a wire transfer though.I meant pressurizationYou wish you were offended by it?  Or that you weren't part of Canada?

But that's sacrilege and joystick or gtfo.I thought it was a rule that you *had* to put the full name of the game on this sub.  It is geared towards keyboard and mouse.

Which is unfortunate for someone like me.  I exclusively use joystick for planes because I find it more fun, but it puts me at a disadvantage in any game mode except full simulator, since it is easier to aim in arcadeâ mode with the mouse.Yes!  WT game modes are split up into Ground Battles (tanks) and Air Battles (planes), and then those are further split into Arcade, Realistic, and Simulator.  Ground Battles - Realistic is the one that allows you to fly both planes and tanks.  You can bomb someone's tank with your plane, and tanks can defend themselves from planes since most of them have machine gun turrets.  You can even shoot a plane out of the sky with your main cannon if you have good aim:

http://i.imgur.com/Ss0j5Wy.gifv

And some planes have high caliber cannons with AP rounds, so you can actually shoot at tanks with your cannons from the air, and penetration is *extremely* realistically simulated in this game, there's a little PiP window that shows you how your round penetrated and/or shattered and which components it hit.  There are no hit points in this game, only components to damage and pilots/crew to kill.Oh yeah and it's cross platform.  Us PC players see all u PS4 players with an asterisk at the end of your name.I was a little surprised and somewhat suspicious that it got upvoted so high, but I can tell you nobody paid me to submit this.Lol that's what happened to me with World of Tanks.  They had a beta test client where you got unlimited currency and could play in the top tier vehicles for free.  Suddenly I realised I didn't enjoy the game, I was just addicted to it.They did 3 of those, fyi.  The other two are called "Heroes" and "The Battle is On!".  I'm on mobile otherwise I'd link them.Tool's all well and good but what are they doing hereWas a one-time april fools event :(War Thunder.  I love it, it's free to play, they make their money off making the "famous" or popular vehicles a very high rank that you have to grind forever to get to, but there's very little pay-to-win in this game.  It's optimized like a dream, it's based off the old IL2 Bird of Prey engine which looks gorgeous while running on a potato, and has settings to go from "will play on laptop onboard graphics" to "will struggle to play on GTX 1080".Nero all the way baby> your anecdotal evidence is cute

Dude, it's possible to raise a counter point without being a dick.

What I'm saying is, it's possible to tax or price floor the product so high that it costs *more* to buy it legally than illegally, and yet still have the majority of people buying it legally.  Although cigarettes were never illegal in the first place, whereas most pot smokers are going to be coming from the black market that they already know and have connections to.  But I wouldn't rule out the legal market being priced higher anyway - we're *still* coming up with new ways to punish tobacco smokers to this day, like banning menthols and plain label packaging.That's the TPS squad car rifle.  These guys are ETF, who definitely have full auto weapons.

Not that it really matters anyway.I just hope that right wing people don't become in charge of administering these laws, to the point where me calling Trump a fat orange Cheeto is hate speech.It was about 20 years ago that the Liberals voted against same sex marriage.  Times they are a changing.I still like it.  But I don't play to grind, I just play to enjoy the vehicles I already have.It's not really April Fools anymore tho, now it's like April Test.  Leopard 2A5's and Hind attack helicopters isn't funny, it's awesome.

**EDIT:** Since this made #1 on /r/all I'm gonna hijack my own top post for some basic info.  

- No you can't fight against the snail anymore, this was 3 years ago

- This year the April event is modern tanks and helicopters (normally the game is just ww2 tanks and planes)

- War Thunder is free to play, anyone can go download it for free right now

- They make their money off of making the popular/famous vehicles like the P-51 or the Tiger tank a very high rank, so they're very slow to grind to, jets and early cold war tanks are even harder to grind to, and you pretty much have to pay if you want to play in one of those any time soon.  But there is very little pay-to-win in this game; once you unlock a P-51, you'll just be flying against other P-51's and vehicles with similar stats.  If you ignore the grind and find a tier 2-3 vehicle you're happy with, the game itself is *extremely* fun, especially using a joystick in simulator mode, even better if you have a VR headset since the 3D cockpits are gorgeous

- It'll run on pretty much anything, doesn't matter if your PC is old or even a laptop.  But it also has settings to crank it to the max to take advantage of your fancy pants GTX 1080.  It's based off the 2009 IL-2 Birds of Prey engine.

- The game is split up into Ground Battles (tanks) and Air Battles (planes), and then those are further split into Arcade, Realistic, and Simulator.  Ground Battles - Realistic is also known as Mixed Mode, since it is the one that allows you to fly both planes and tanks.  You can bomb someone's tank with your plane, and tanks can defend themselves from planes since most of them have machine gun turrets.  Some planes have high caliber cannon rounds that can take on tanks.  You can even shoot a plane out of the sky with your main cannon if you have good aim:

http://i.imgur.com/Ss0j5Wy.gifv

- There are no hit points in this game.  Only components to destroy and crew to kill.  Destroying a plane is obvious, but to destroy a tank you have to either kill all its crew, detonate its ammo rack, or detonate its fuel tanks.

- Armor penetration is the most detailed and realistic I've seen in any big multiplayer game.  Round penetration is modeled based on round type, mass, velocity, and angle relative to target, and then internal damage is modeled based on the round ricocheting or fragmenting into multiple shards, or detonating as some rounds can penetrate and then explode.  You even get a little picture-in-picture window showing you how your round damaged their tank and which components, and same goes for you when you get killed by one of their tanks:

https://gfycat.com/WearyHauntingAmmoniteWar ThunderWar Thunder, free to playI remember the last class action suit against Bell, was against their practice of throttling the torrent protocol between 4pm and 2am.  Anything that used bittorrent, not just piracy but legal games like World of Tanks or War Thunder, was limited to 50kB/s no matter what speed you were paying for.  Thousands of reports about it on dslreports.com.

Finally they filed a class action, and practically over night the throttling ended.I just assumed it was a couple dozen people using botsWhen game devs have a sense of humor, you say?
