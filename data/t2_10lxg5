This wasn't me and I wasn't even there, but I heard a story of a pretty bad first date. I delivered for an Applebees through GrubHub. One day I overheard one of the managers talking by chance. He said that the night before a couple came in on their first date. I think they were in their 30s-40s. Anyway at some point the woman literally dropped dead at her table. The guy went with her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead. And then the guy had to deal with the grieving mother because he didn't know what to do or when to leave or anything. Pretty sure a date couldn't go much worse than that for either of them.You're massively overestimating the driving ability of like 80% of people."What were the things in Gremlins called?" - Karl Pilkington I'm imagining a black hole so large, that from any observer in the universe the event horizon would appear as the edge of space time because it distorts space time so immensely.People don't understand that losing weight is about this battle. You can lose as much as you want in whatever time that you want to do it in, if you don't have a permanent solution you'll bounce back. Well, not everybody will, but that's how it goes for me.Life is suckFor real man. This guy won the lawsuit lottery.In this situation I think you're best and most reasonable course of action would be to whisper back "And you're mistake was (screaming this next part) ASSUMING I WOULD EVER TRUST ANYBODY!!" and then you just stab her right there and you wave your bloody knife in the air as a display of dominance. Oh and if anybody approaches you stab them as well.The other officer's just like, "Hey..well...we don't need to...oh alright then."I was expecting little Zeldaesqe 3D chess pieces made from polygons like 3D models. Don't know why my expectations were so high. Pretty awesome chess board though.Is Jackass still a thing? Would love to see the Jackass guys do this.I love how the picture has that slight motion blur.

"We don't have time to stop and take pics. We gotta get outta here."Exactly. Probably the 60s actually. Actually no that would have been black and white.Wrong, this is actually a portal that leads straight to the TARDIS.They could have contacted McDonalds to extort them for advertisement money; saying that they were considering Burger King, Taco Bell, etc. and would feature the highest bidder, when in reality it was always just them.Haha I honestly don't remember anymore. Super high."Pagan Sacrificial Temple"The application opens up a small window that should be in the center of one of your screens and you pick the number for the monitor you want in a drop down list. It shouldn't automatically open Cemu in your second monitor.You don't have to exit full screen to run the game. The menu should be there at the top still and you can just load up games like normal in full screen. If you ever leave full screen on your second monitor and switch to anything else then you'll have to relaunch Cemu with the application to get full screen on your second monitor again.I've seen animals freeze temporarily. I've also heard this can be fixed by turning GPU buffer accuracy to high but can't confirm that, nor do I think running that setting would be of any use in BotW in the current build.Just wait it out. Mine was stuck there for 2-3 minutes once (i5 6600k).BOTW seems to to lean towards doing this when you first get close to new stuff and new areas. It seems to be related to switching from one area of the map to the other graphically. I can't tell much but I'm not getting this if I just hang around in a village and cook 20 meals and talk to everyone, but if I go climbing mountains it'll happen within 10 minutes, or at least will soft lock. Not exactly ideal but I'm still having an amazing time and I'm like 6 hours in.Well if you're waiting 10 minutes every time you start the dang game then you're definitely losing time in the long run, defeating the purpose of having a pre built shader cache. It's not that bad to just have them compile while you're playing and deal with a few frame drops The first time you play.Go to:

Cemu Folder/shaderCache/transferable

Delete everything in that folder

Now you have no shader caches and will have to recache them the first time you do stuff in games. But when Cemu loads the games shaders it will take 5 seconds instead of 10 minutes.I don't know I think of the green lattice as more of a playground for all to enjoy. This looks like people are having more fun than if it were an orderly grid.This is definitely narrowing in on the problem. After disconnecting and reconnecting the controller does not appear in the windows list of controllers. But it does work in all of my other emulators perfectly even though windows doesn't list it there, so this is still a Cemu specific problem for me. So how do I get windows to not forget the controller then?r/linktoasubredditthatispertinenttothisconversationintherightcontextRight well it does not do this for me. If I open the input settings the box is red and controls cannot be mapped. This is actually what I've been doing to check if the controller is connected before loading up games to save myself some time.wired or wireless?Didn't work. Once the controller is disconnected the box in input settings is red and controls cannot be mapped for controller. Opening and closing input settings makes no difference. Must be a different system than the Xbox One controllers.They just already know about Lisa's shit and aren't going to let this guy get stuck with it for life. This guy should be thanking them.This did not fix my problem.Though I agree this is an excellent and tasteful comeback, I think it's too outrageous an encounter to think of witty comebacks. It took me half the video just to figure out wtf was going on. It takes your brain a minute to go through the options of "maybe she's not crazy, oh wait no she's fucking nuts" and probably the couple was doubting themselves for a short period. And this woman is yelling basically word salad the whole time, coming right up to the couple saying some more shit that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. And part of your brain is going "Is this a real person? Is she really like this? Wtf is she actually thinking that would make her say this?" And with this woman it's actually half-figure-out-able. Then she says on the phone "There is a man here that was about to have sex," and that's just too much for my brain at least. If it were me there is no way there would have been a witty comeback.I think it's slightly rude sometimes, but I've never had a reaction stronger than smirking and thinking "Well then."You vote 2 in 1 direction and 1 in the other direction. If everybody does this it fucks it the most.Yeah this application is what I use to launch Cemu  in fullscreen on my 2nd monitor. Haven't run into any problems with it.Pretty sure you can get a copy of that image with near zero effort for free when this is done. Just google 'custom poster' and you'll find places where you can upload any image and have a poster printed of basically any size. You could even get time lapse pictures of it and have frames for every hour or every few hours and make a grid out of it for the poster.Why weld the last link though? Would have been fine not welded and just slipped on there normally. You could achieve the same effect. But the welded on link hints, to me at least, that something is fishy and could lead someone to figuring out what is shown in this gif.Oh man I laughed too hard at this."Pentagon Interior 7

(ノ ゜Д゜)ノ ︵ ┻━┻ ...Yeah I think context is key. I think almost certainly it was this guy being an evil cunt for no reason. But it could have been that this pack of dogs have been fucking with them all day. They just want to hang out at the beach but these fucking dogs just won't leave them alone. Stealing towels, flinging sand on them, running up and biting them in the ass, these dogs were out of control. So one of them goes, "You know what, I'm not taking this shit from these crazy dogs. I'm gonna show them who's boss." Just saying that's a possibility too.Damn, people are driving right through that thick smoke at full speed. That's hardcore af. Guess they had somewhere important to be.Ctrl+Shift+N in Crome starts an incognito window

In incognito mode you always appear as a brand new user. Long story short you can use it to get around the paywall and read the articles like normal. Works on all the sites that do this.This little cubby actually seems like a shit idea to me. Now you have to take your phone out and use it normally any time you want to do anything. How often are you just sitting there looking at it? Not longer than a few minutes. Seriously just being responsible and remotely tidy with your phone on the table takes near zero effort. High at work 100% of the time. It just flies by.I reuploaded it. Hope it works now. Didn't bother to rename though because I'm lazy.This is the goldest gold comment that was ever gilded gold golded.I delivered food in Chicago for a while and there are a few high rise apartment buildings where on super windy days the elevators get triggered like a door was being opened and stop. All you had to do was kick the door and it would keep going. Glad someone was there with me the first time it happened or I definitely would have been stuck.Most modern cars are FWD. But probably the cars around there in Africa are mostly RWD.1: Make racist comment

2: Get called out

3: Say it's OK because you're black

4: Get fuck loads of karmaSupercars are really just fancy go karts with expensive bodywork.It's like, if you saw pictures of this you'd say, "That's stupid. It clearly wouldn't drive. Maybe it can go 5pmh."

But seeing this video it's pretty clear that this little thing kicks ass. Guy is a legend.I think this belongs in some other 'I can hold my own beer' subYo tag this NSFWThe engine looks too big to be a beetle engine. Though I'm no Beetle expert. Also it looks like the chassis is all hand made by this guy. The wheelbase looks a bit short for a dune buggy.You don't need to do a full hanging sit up is what I'm saying. I think you could get your shoes off with just your feet. This it's just a matter of grabbing the fence and lifting yourself up a little so you can slip your legs out of the pants.Pretty sure it's just a matter of being able to take your shoes off and slip your feet out. Perfect title

10 points to GriffindorBecause If you're hanging upside down by your pants there is no escape?The frame work actually looks pretty intricate. Probably not the best, but I think it's clear that this thing is for real and isn't going to break down after 5 miles.[source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dchpWG_iOXI)Mid engine, RWD, probably under a ton honestly. I don't know how much power it has but I think this qualifies as a supercar. And just look at that spoiler!And he even had the sense to make it RWD so that he can give it some oversteer. This fucking guy. Forgot to put the backplate in. And I'm fucking not taking out my motherboard to put it in.This got me thinking that maybe it will be a thing with self driving cars that people try to go to sleep for long journeys and then shitheads can play the game of looking for sleeping drivers and waking them up for fun.I'll submit the first one to get things rolling.

[Guy fixing a pipe](http://www.portsideplumbing.com/communities/5/000/001/516/075//images/6598862.jpg)Honestly if I'd have known it was going to go this bad for them I'd have voted all Republican last November. 

FYI Joke username, not Trump supporter, actually voted all DemIf we just make the Jews wear these then we can tell which ones are Jews.Oh man hated this so much. I bought this game to shotgun 5 guys in the face at once in bullet time, not to do some fucking fucked not even half assed platforming on pools of blood in some dream world. Yeah, fuck all that.I've made a list of links to what I consider to be significant or noteworthy works old and new of all genres. This should be a way different selection than what other people are offering, though some of this stuff was probably mentioned. If you want to get serious about listening to all you can there is a band called Godspeed You! Black Emperor that I highly recommend and I can give you loads of links to great weird stuff if you want. Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Daft Punk, Radiohead, and David Bowie are all things you should be listening to. I think I linked a Radiohead song. Anyway, these are all great and are worth listening to start to finish.

Looks like Haas is already doing better than McLaren Honda lmao.Yeah I had noticed. There's nowhere else to share my genius though.What kind of games do you like/did you used to enjoy? I'll bet if you list your gaming experience here and what you really like we can tell you which type of games to aim for and what specific titles you might like. Most modern games are shit and you need to know what to get or you won't have fun. Personally I've been playing mostly emulators lately. Ever seen an arcade machine you wish you could have played? You can with MAME, an emulator that plays pretty much any arcade game. Also I've been playing PS2, Wii U, Gamecube, N64 etc. Lots of great games for absolutely free if you have no problems with pirating (it's super easy). I think the modern trend of first person shooters has been filth since like 2004.

My main gaming is in my driving simulator. I use a simulation program that is used by Formula 1 teams. My steering wheel gives better feedback than my real car. It's all of my dreams come true. You might not have such an obvious groove, but you'll probably find something that lights your trousers on fire at least a little.

Also don't beat yourself up about having wasted money on a computer. Part of having a fast computer is not having to get a new computer for 2-3 more years. In Chicago (probably other places too) they'll stick the ticket on with this sticky stuff that essentially will never come off of your car. If they're really feeling like a dick or if you were really a dick they'll stick it on your driver's side mirror. It's a nightmare. You'll spend an hour and only just make it like 30% less visible. I never really cared about getting tickets but fuck was I terrified about having to clean that sticky stuff off again.It looks a lot more like a Mars rover than a tractor.Wow I can't see them at all. I'm looking really close and I'm still not 100% convinced but I'll take your word for it.Guy does a really good job at that tricky transition from creepy, homeless looking stranger to guy everyone is listening to.Is this guy seriously wearing all that shit on his face and not goggles, literally the only thing you need for airsoft.Can you get pet otters? Otter owners of reddit: how are pet otters?

[further googles pet otters]The poor guy. You gotta see this guy. He goes "Aaaagh information isn't preserved in black holes." Then it turns out that's wrong. Now he's saying he's wrong. This was 40 years ago, they didn't do a retraction. Sad.Sometimes you've just had it up to here with your SO and need some me time.COULDN'T SHE JUST FEED THEM THE SCRAPS!!!!!?It's usually like, "Hey this guy's not so bad." Then they won't stop talking about some demon lord shit that seemingly has no correlation to reality and you can't make any sense of it at all let alone remember any of it to post on Reddit when you're recalling the story.Holy shit man where do you live?He made up this page for show for the video. His real studying goes like you imagine with huge blocks of yellow."Prices will increase" is a huge understatement for what is going to happen to like 30% of people under GOPcare.Yeah shit like this is why I watch stuff online. Also because it's free, more easily accessible, contains a volume of entertainment probably thousands of times larger than what is available even with DVR, isn't limited to my region or country, and has no commercials.So that's how terrible it would be to go on a cruise ship (guy who gets seasick extremely easily).Guy who set this up: "Hey we don't have enough tacos to go all the way around out here. Do we have more tacos?"

Other guy: "You could just put this log here in the gap"This is how you do taco Tuesday. Also is that log clean?It's like he meant to say this but then "girlfriend" came out instead. I'm thinking even if this guy isn't cheating he's in a world of shit right now.Too bad this company refuses to move away from inauthentic physics simulation.

There's a Wii U emulator now that plays Breath of the Wild in 4k. Currently it has some bugs, but I'd say that by the end of the month Breath of the Wild will be playable on mid range PCs.Honestly this kind of person is usually super respectful around here (St. Louis) as long as you're not being a dick. It's always someone in a fucked up 2003 Impala or just a complete cunt in a modern Nissan Altima. Maybe it's different in different places but I tend to not have problems with this kind of guy in this starter pack.
