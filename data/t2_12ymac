It's a great service, I wish I used it when it was part of Picasa, Maybe I wouldn't‚Äã have lost 4 years worth of digital photos that got forever lost due to hard drives deathsI have an MSI laptop, never again will they fool me again.It's been seven years or so since I stop being Christan, for the most part I didn't miss it, mostly because of my anger towards it, feeling how I didn't allow me to experience a lot of things you can only do as a teenager,  but not so long ago I went through a very traumatic experience, and that knock me off really hard, and for the first time In a long time I missed the comfort of believing that at the end everything will be ok because God will help you make it through it all.... And even made a small prayer saying someone like: God, I Know you don't actually exist, but I really need some to talk right now, or something along those lines, I even sang a few religious songs, but after while I began feeling better again and went back to my usual self.

There are non religious ways to deal with pain and anxiety, like philosophy or meditation, I would be nice to hear experiences from second or third generation atheist/agnostics, I believe every first generation non believer can, under certain circumstances, have a temporaly roll back to their previous believes.

Cheer up, we're all gonna die in the end anyway, and all our achievements and struggles are meaningless on the bigger picture of the universe, we might as well try to make the best out our lives while we can.

Well, here in my country, Gang leaders‚Äã coordinate, send treats and extort using WhatsApp voice notes, all within‚Äã the prison walls, that kind of make me want the government to have full access to WhatsApp to keeps records of this illegal activity‚Äã.Hello there, let me share with you some quotes I really like:

"Sweetie, you know I support you, whatever you want to do, but you're not gonna find what you're looking for in these awful made-up places. The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't a search for meaning. It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you'll be dead".
Mr. Peanutbutter /Bojack Horseman

"Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody's gonna die. Come watch TV".
Rick / Rick and Morty.


Also, you're quite young, the  chemical on your teenage brain may be messing your mind right now, but your body chemistry, and thus your views on yourself and the world will change a lot by your 20s, and 30s and so on.

You might be thinking you're the only one in your school that feels that way, but it's more common of what you think, specially at your age.

If you love somebody that doesn't mean they will love you back, that's a fact of life, also you shouldn't do good things for others expecting then to do good things for you, that will only lead to disappointment, If you want do good deeds do it for the satisfaction of helping make the world a better place, if not just not messing with others is good enough. 

The group of people you know is not the whole world, expand your horizons, allow yourself to meet new people, you may eventually meet someone you can relate better. 

It's all meaningless in the end anyway :P so don't worry that much, I certainly believe that life is overrated, but death is a permanent state, so might as well try to make the best out of the experience, look for a hobby, try exercising a little bit, read a good book, life isn't so bad if you don't put much though to it. While I don't mind sponsored content, his focus has indeed change, since the first beta of Android O launched the same time I found odd that he didn't do a first impressions video, as he done with previous versions of Android, listing top or new favorite features and whatnot, but oh well, time change, people change.App crashes every often, at random Java timeout error as wellWhat pisses me off are religious leaders migrating from under develop nation's to delevoped countries saying that its was God's will to do so, like Jonas Gonzales from  Enlace (biggest Spanish Christian TV Network, like TBN in the US), his Network recivives millions from donations, which they collect four times each year during TV marathons asking for then, on which they promise‚Äã God's blessings if you donate, and he of course move form Costa Rica to the USA. A good bussinees indeed, cashing of the hopes of helpless suckers and living the good life whit it. 


Those Naggers I remember one time I was waiting for my turn on an Apple service center, the guys in front of me tried to upgrade the hardrive of an iMac themselves, apparently they broke a cable of something, and only solution offered to then was to replace the motherboard‚Äã, that's part of the reasons I didn't but another Mac after my 2010 MacBook pro died, I don't like the direction Apple has taken regardless they computers, making then very hard to repair and with not easy to access ram and HDD.Volta never seems like an improvement in my testing, Doze did increased stand by time lot, on lollipop if I forget to charge my phone on the night it would certainly be dead by morning, while on Doze it make it through the nightEnter the recovery and delete cache partition, that usually helps, if no do a backup of your data a do a factory reset.You could flash some official firmware from other region to enable the fingerprint reader.Why gapless isn't standard on Android?You know what I want?
