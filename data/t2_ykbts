GUYS I FOUND THE TIME MACHINE BACK TO 2014Count me in!Can you say partyboat?!Someone told the cat to recreate Stone Cold Steve Austin's theme song.  It started off pretty good too.that post gave me flashbacks of "I TANK GOGOGOGOGOGO" from the hunter/priest/mage/anything-but-the-tank from Hakkar.

They were always from Hakkar.but even higherIt's the salty vegan, too!This lives inside the murderkube, right?Cue the image of the police weapons sweep confiscating a bike wheel.

A fucking bike wheel.I hope in 40 years there's a big ol' database of people with these kinds of tattoos checking in again.  Wonder how 60-70 year old pic related is doing then.  And more importantly, if his beard's come in properly yet.a perfect roach, right until ol' vicegrips charlie gets his clamps on it.

(then it springs back and you're like yeeeah boi)Yeah pretty much.Remember the $60million Sega paid Gearbox to make that game, and then they spent all that money on other projects?  Pepperidge Farm remembers that too.playing the stock market.Nice assumptions there.a parking brake pedal?

**WHAT IN TARNATION**Totally bad speaker placement, but if you're missing your clutch pedal, you're doing something wrong.For me I enjoy the raw helmet cam or replay camera, and I know many folk will disagree here (for good reason) but I enjoy it when someone adds in music to match the mood of the video or sync up with the driving, be it by chance or deliberately.Sadly OP is always a faggot and won't deliver, but by god do I want to see him deliver.Yeah, it's holidays where finns and scots aren't invited to.Re-uploaded to remove the username, but hey try having a look yourself (not for the name I mean), go to your favorite cucked subreddit that spams shitloads of anti trump or anti brexit stuff, and check the account age.  9/10 times the age will be sitting at that 4/5 year mark.
spez: [Here's another not quite at 4 years,](http://i.magaimg.net/img/a5w.png) and [another.](http://i.magaimg.net/img/a5x.png)Hey I knew things at age 5.  Like how to ride a bike with no stabilizers.Preaching to the choir my dude, most of the people I know who also voted to leave knew fine well there'd be a very high chance of economic issues, but that wasn't anywhere near why we were voting to leave.  Also dat post below fits how I felt about brexit, "What am I gonna do, say no?  Fuck that, MBGA"Try it for yourself, pedes!  Look through the fully cucked subreddits for their hard anti-trump posts, the accounts are 90% of the time sitting on that 4/5 year old mark.Came here to ask about that, good to see it's getting another lease of life then, looks real neato.I do expect them to treat me differently, given that it's THE LAW TO SEE ME PUT TO DEATH.Fuck off, homophobe.If you're gay, no. It's such a beautiful land, shame I'd be executed for my lifestyle if I ever visited.V70 T5 my dude."Aww crap-snacks, how could this get--"

"Gone to outer space~  To shoot that dickbag, in his face~"That's what's going to happen.  In fact, that's exactly what my final point was about.He sure isn't gonna make your life great again.  Don't think it was to begin with.Every terrorist attack in the last few years in the UK has been perpetrated by someone known to MI5.  They knew about the assailant, and they knew something was going to happen.  This is just a grab for even more unwarranted mass surveillance.   And it's not like there's such thing as a saturation of useless data, no siree!That thing's gonna piss in your purse, and you'll write a great song about it.>  The Japanese were reliable but felt like wet blankets.

On this part and this part alone I have to disagree.  I had a mk2 MR2 for a while, it was reliable as hell no doubt, but by god it wasn't a wet blanket.  It was the reincarnation of Sweeney fucking Todd.  It was razor sharp and ready to yank that thing across my jugular at a moment's notice.

Moral of the story: If you get a MK2, don't get one from before 93 unless you want to slide backwards into a tree due to snap oversteer.

Would be a baller as fuck way to crash through the pearly gates, mind you...Man, a lick of paint and a few more flowers along the way and it'd look really lovely.  Hell, just a once over with a few powerwashers and that'd be enough.I can see you were learning about asymmetry, but this is some next level stuff.When your luck score is 11/10, your name is Yitzhak Ganon.I was an EMT on that fateful day, enjoying a bit of downtime for once, and then my co-worker comes in.  These days I'm not quite sure what he actually said to me, he truly had a way with words, but I was a believer from then on out.  I understood everything and what we had to do.

He gave me a book on the matter to read through, and learn from.  Boy howdy did I.  Later that evening, the MPs get word of what's going on, and come along with the chaplain to our workplace.  It was a massacre, such horrific actions should never happen, but it was Her will.

After the horrific bloodbath, there were only 9 survivors, but Her will must be done.

I got out of it, by summoning Her, turning into some weird fuckin' fly thing and the round ending. 

^^^^^Honk.
