Still using my S4 and it's fine, I agree it is starting to feel slightly outdated but it's good enough, I don't really get why people want to upgrade phones every year or two.How about overthrow everyone except maybe 10% of Parliament and replace with decent people instead of greedy little pricks? Probably because they can't afford it, with that behaviour I wonder why?Yeah that is the issue, it's not AMD's fault at all which is why I brought Freesync but then my R9 290 dies and I'm left buying a 1070 and for the last 9 months not being able to use any adaptive refresh, I've had the monitor 11 months :(Keep it as a spare, I've got a second hand HD 6670 that I got for £25 which can power most games at 720p/30fps low, kind of regret selling my HD 7850's as they'd be excellent "spares".Oh shit that could've been much worse if you cut into a tendon, glad you only need some stitches. I really need to get a 21:9 monitor but none support 144hz at decent resolution :(I wouldn't do it, try looking for a R9 390 this way you don't get Crossfire issues, tried it once and it had way too many quirks.This is why I always prefer reviews from users with half decent knowledge tell me what they think.Just keep it new and sealed and then sell it for mega money in another 20 years.Until you throw up.Nope thankfully I won't be having a 8k monitor for at least 10 years, well not so thankfully as I'd like 8k 144hz :DBecause of the 3.5GB VRAM scandal, they did have 4GB but 512mb was so slow it gimped the card.It's what I use on my Faplet.I never knew much about WWI but since BF 1 I have actually took more interest in it and how it all started, I was surprised to learn that it was mostly Austria that wanted war and how Germany mostly followed because they gave their word. Not a bad idea, Nuke NK and pretend they did it themselves, China/US/Japan and may others would probably keep quiet about it considering how much of a nuisance they (NK) are. Sounds like Nazi France in "Inglorious Bastards".Maybe you got lucky? I do wonder if it is to do with dud IMC's, I'd be interested in a thread with 1700/1700x/1800x and see what RAM speeds and sets people can run, how is the ASRock Taichi? If I was gonna buy a board it'd be the CH6.Considering I have a "decent" PC I'll wait it out until 2018 and see what Zen+ and Cannon Lake bring, the 1700 looks excellent but I don't want any RAM issues, I overclocked my ram from 1600mhz to 1866mhz and it helped massively with my minimums in BF 1 by at least 10%-20%.I use to have Cheat Engine installed but I bugged out incase I left it running.Yeah I paid almost full price for the first and regretted it, felt so lifeless and getting killed by the hero's pissed me off, I have never watched Star Wars so maybe that is why I didn't like it.That smile looks like he's gonna pop out and kill you :/ Evil smile...TBF I hate the Steam Trading Cards I do like the market however the 15% charge is rather steep and I'd rather buy on OPSkins. I get angry that Steam has that monopoly over the PC gaming scene but people don't seem to want to support anything else, Origin, GOG and Steam are decent Uplay does suck balls though.What if you brought from the US and came back to Canada? Would that change matters?Luckily I live in the UK and corruption is fairly low however what bothers me is with Brexit I feel that might change.I use Private Internet Access they say they don't keep logs but you never know however speeds are decent for my needs and it's fairly reliable and cheap, about $25-$30 a year.You need to go into memory timing mode and change it, should be auto/expert/ and some other setting. It will then unlock the sub timings which you want to be 16-16-16-16-36, if I'm right it should be good but atm the timings are tight and looking good, if you are running 2933mhz I'd probably leave it how it is as you'll more than likely get better performance with tighter timings.

Basically you need to change Memory Timing Mode from auto then go to Memory Sub Timings and input the right ones, if you are stable with them being lower it's better.It's gotten much better over the last year or two and it'll only keep improving, maybe screensavers will not be a thing of the past...I love the term Wank-Puffin.If ya motherboard supports it get a [Q6600](http://ark.intel.com/products/29765/Intel-Core2-Quad-Processor-Q6600-8M-Cache-2_40-GHz-1066-MHz-FSB) and pair it with a better GPU, a GTX 1050ti or RX 460 would work well depending on the PSU, if you need something even cheaper a second hand 750tii for $50 would be "okay".Unless you find one second hand for £40 ;-) Just thought I'd say that for the performance that is the max you want to be spending on a 750ti, not a bad card for low end gaming though.Always worry about leaks with water cooling, not because it's bad but because I'd probably fuck it up somehow.Could go Ryzen now for desktop if you need one, RAM issues aside it looks decent although I'll be waiting for Coffee Lake and Zen+ before making my discussion.Z77 boards are like gold dust now, luckily Ryzen is here to finally give us that boost in the CPU market that has been stagnant for so long!The community is horrid, I never go near it because 80% of the users just want to troll and if you have a problem running a game it's "YOU HAVE A POTATO PC GET A NEW ONE!" or "MAD COS BAD", I like the phone verification but it's kinda a shame you can't just use Google Authenticator instead of or with Steam Authenticator.Don't get all the hate on Origin it works well and EA Access is decent for the amount of titles you get to play, I might not like their tactics but this one is actually decent.OLED with that would be beautiful. Maybe in 10 years.Go into the BIOS and have a look around, you'll need to go under the frequency settings and you should be able to choose which timings to change, I can't tell you exactly what to do as I can't see what you have in BIOS, could always post screenshots and I'll be more help. This will help you it might be old but the same rules apply.

Basically IIRC CL-16 RTC-16 RTP-16 TRAS-36. That is what you need under the slightly advanced frequency.What annoys me more than anything is how before dropping big money not looking and seeing how things perform with pricing, just google GTX 960, you'll see how it pairs and know if it's worth the money or not.It's stupid how us EU'ers didn't get this, Brussels bangs on and on about how they protect us and we got nothing!Should be on the kits, just write them down if you have the model number then you can google them and take a photo on your phone. If you are unsure of what the timings mean then a quick google will help you, XMP is more of an Intel thing IIRC and doesn't seem to work so well on AMD setups, it kinda works but sometimes bugs out.I agree this is possible and awhile I know this thank you for taking the time to enlighten me, I'm sure plenty of people here will benefit from your advice. I don't do anything illegal so if the government want to look at me they are more than welcome to however they will be wasting time and money in doing so. Hate to be this guy but all I keep hearing is about the Hillsborough disaster, I feel for the people that died and the families that got lied too by the police/government and media however it doesn't seem to be a month go by without this being brought up. I think the price is worth it considering how much things cost, I pay for a VPN yearly just for some privacy, it might not matter but it makes me feel better so worth it.Not really an idiot, you can make mistakes without being stupid, we've all made them at least he's being honest.Oh well at least it thins out the overpopulation slightly! /s I've always overclocked my CPU/RAM with the BIOS not software because it's always been buggy for me although that might have changed since my hardware is 5 years old. 

If you are struggling with XMP the best option is to manually dial in the timings and frequency, I remember having that XMP issue when I first got my rig as the BIOS was rather bugged at that time.It depends, I had a HD 7850 2GB in 2012, Crossfired them in 2013 and brought a R9 290 in 2014 before it died last year and I upgraded to a GTX 1070 in 2016, I'd like to think around 2 years but if VEGA looks decent I'll sell up and buy it.Not sure about that looking at the benchmarks 8 months ago but maybe things changed?Sounds like she had the IQ of a 2 year old... How old was she :PDon't have kids buy GT-R be happy problem solved?Okay.If you already have the cooler then you won't be getting anything near the CM 212 within that price range, just something to bear in mind.Save the money from upgrading buy the stocks and you might even make money :DI think it will but not the first iteration of it."Updating" is that like Skylake and Kabylake? When the process matures and they just overclock it slightly? That isn't my idea of updating, that is my idea of flogging a dead horse for the $$$.Is that pushed to 4.1ghz? If so I'd keep that! If not then I'd go slightly further, I can't really advise you with Ryzen as I have never touched it, I have overclocked plenty though :DTBF if you have a cooler that can get the updated mounts it's worth keeping them and saving the $30 if not you can buy a very decent cooler or okay AIO with $30.I'd push for 4.1 and see what voltage you need, if temps are decent I'd keep it. On air it's heat that kills first just look at all those LN2 suicide runs and how much voltage get pumped into the chip...It's the same with every chip, Ivy Bridge/Haswell have been the same be glad you can get 1700x speeds out of a 1700! Maybe instead of spending $700 on a custom loop it would've been wiser to buy the 1800x :DR7 1700 with the stock cooler.He can upgrade it when he has more money, worse thing is being bottlenecked by a newish monitor.Agreed the first card I ever bought was a Sapphire Dual-X HD 7850 2GB, great card and I even brought a second hand MSI Twin Frozr to Crossfire them. In the end I got rid of them for the R9 290 because I got fed up with the stuttering from the 2GB VRAM and Crossfire however in games that worked well it was better than the R9 290. Yeah I don't really get it either because the HD 7970 was awesome along with the R9 290 except that suffered with not having AIB for a good couple of months, I brought a reference and had to put the gelid icy vision on it, which wasn't that much better tbf.This and keep the RX 470 and buy a 144hz 1080p monitor, trust me you'll love it and lowering some settings will get you some gains.For all the people wanting VEGA if AMD can't give enough power and you need to upgrade now just jump to the 1070/1080/1080ti, the waiting game is mental, brought the 1070 as a stopgap for the last 8 months awhile waiting.Find all the kiddy porn take it down and find out who has downloaded it, something I can't stand with everything that is bad on the internet I think this is one of the absolute highest.Just an FYI he's English.IMO the 1600x vs 1700 it cost an extra £50 for the 1700 so I'd always go for the 1700, extra 2c/4t for £50 is so hard to give up. 1800x just isn't worth the extra outlay.Depends on how much money you have, for me if I was doing it right now maybe the 1600x then upgrade to Zen+ in 2018 selling off the 1600x then, but on the other hand buy the 1700 and don't bother upgrading :DHappy Cake day :-)Modern Warfare was just great, simple but fun. WAW buggy sure but had zombies and WWII, MW2 started going nuts with killstreaks and perks so to me it was when it started going downhill but fun then BO 1 which was decent but still went downhill hard here for me.The Aorus is certainly giving ROG Asus a run for it's money, I like the X370 boards too but they are slightly lacking on the VRM's, however it is also £35-£50 cheaper.It's what stops me thinking about it, BIOS updates imo will not fix it as I believe it has something to do with the IMC, plenty of kits work on Intel platforms at the rated speeds but not on Ryzen, I'll wait until Zen+ in 2018, the kinks should be fixed and more clock speed should be available.Well good job on the guys that recorded this, he should get some nice compo now and those guys lose their jobs, I'm not normally shocked at what I see but this has, first time I've been shocked and saddened by something I've see here.

Just shows that having phones with cameras is one of the best inventions.I do have Freesync but have a GTX 1070 so can't use it, when I had my R9 290 it helped, it's something I can live without but would be nice to have if possible.It's more the minimums that screw me over, if those stay above 60/70 fps then I'm good, higher is always nicer but it only hits you when it drops stupidly low with microstutter.Just saying I prefer the Ryzen logo, it's the best AMD have done to date and shows something different.It also gets you high, smelling it and getting on the hands :DNot exactly true, if AMD launched something worth having I'd buy it, coming from a R9 290 I had nothing to upgrade to when it died leaving me with either the 1070 or 1080, I chose the 1070 thinking I could upgrade to VEGA, this was over 8 months ago.Can't go without the 144hz since I've tried it.Has a 6.2L Hemi :DI know just thought I'd say about the war crime involving the blankets for the people that didn't get the joke.So let them go and be separate with no benefits from us, I'm sure they would fail and come back wanting help from us which we should then ignore. Scotland are independent except being part of the UK, like I say if they also want to leave the UK then that would be fine too but don't come complaining when they want back in. We gave them blankets filled with Smallpox, probably one of the worst war crimes IMO.Using phone while driving naughty naughty!It's looked like something out of GTA!I love Freesync but we need AMD to get VEGA out before I can buy that.You won't have any issues with Amazon getting it sorted but that doesn't stop it being a total pisstake, IMO Amazon needs to stop scammers abusing returns.The R5' are just R7's that have defective cores IIRC, the RAM is a problem because of how picky motherboards/IMC is with it, you are right Samsung B-Die is what you want for the best chance but much comes to luck.Without us Scotland would be a total mess, I've had enough of them threatening us I'd like to just kick them out and leave them too it. What do they export SAF and scotch?Get the Crosshair, it's the better board imo with more VRM's.Nah Sapphire Nitro :D 

XFX build quality always seems lacking to me.It's not worry it's great, means AMD should have something worth hitting back with, if that is the case I'm forced to buy Ryzen cos my 3570k bottlenecks my 1070!Timings are important, I'd rather get the lowest timings possible but price is worth factoring into the situation.The biggest cons for me is the immature platform, requires fast memory which is hard to do considering BIOS/IMC or some other bug stopping it from happening, I'm a great believer that 2018 will be the best time to upgrade, we will have Intel thinking new ideas (hopefully) and Zen+ with all the issues ironed out and hopefully the memory will clock even higher, if I didn't have a PC now I'd certainly buy the 1700 but for now I can hold off, I'll want to upgrade for the next Battlefield for sure however.

It's a shame DDR3 is now EOL and expensive as hell because I'd like to sell my old 4x4GB sticks and buy some 2x8GB 2400mhz just too see if that improved performance but the platform is dead and I don't want to sink more cash as it'd be flogging a dying horse.How do I turn windows game mode on? Does it do it without any input from the user? Sounds like I could do with it myself, I struggle with BF 1 with my 3570k.I'm looking forward to Rising Storm 2, plenty of good exclusives on this platform too.Probably only coded to see that a newer version of drivers is available, I agree I like to stick with slightly older drivers and let other download the latest, leave it a day or two and if no bad reports get them myself.By the sound of things you'd be better off finding a job elsewhere.
