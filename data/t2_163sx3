Maybe we have a politician here who actually 'gets it' ?It's the same argument which was made after the San Bernardino attack - will almost certainly be the same result as well.

If the system is deliberately weakened then it's over for them so I suspect they will resist this in quite a big way.It's worked before...Isn't it secure ?Not everything is about terrorism, this ignorant woman already knows this of course.

She just wants more power.

When 'they' prevent a terrorist attack there are arrests and subsequent prosecutions. Security Service involvement might not be publicised but the original intent of the terrorists and the prosecution are definitely published.
I'm not surprised
