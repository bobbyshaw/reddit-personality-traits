The problem with socialism is the assumption that wealth is a big eternal pie, with some privileged to treat it as an all-you-can-eat buffet and many on the outside looking in, lucky to get occasional crumbs. When you see that as true, naturally you wish to make the sharing of pie more fair and equitable.
 
The productive mindset sees the path to wealth as baking, a set of skills and processes useful to meeting needs by making pies, an easily learned craft practiced with readily affordable tools and ingredients. Pies will always be available as there are always pie makers making pie.
 
Except, people are quite calculating. Productive pie makers look ahead to determine how many pies of what types will be needed and whether they can be made at such cost that it is worth the effort. When socialism takes hold and they have to surrender two of each dozen pies, perhaps it still appears to be worth the effort. But then it's three per dozen, then four...
 
Pretty soon, pie makers are calculating "why should I go to all this bother when I can just wait and get the pies I need personally for free?" At that point, you look around and you've run out of other people's pies.
 
The wealth of a society comes overwhelmingly from one single source--the ability of enterprising people to look to the future and see the opportunity to make profits (an evil concept to socialists). When they can, they get busy and the productive cycle starts that brings employment and goods and services. When they can't, they register with the government to be sure to get their share of the pie, what little there is.

Short answer is that everyone benefits under capitalism, especially the poorest of our citizens.Methodology anyone? This is a very unscientific study, and the questions they asked were very loaded questions to begin with. I can't actually believe they are pushing this as news.Seems like no one is talking about it. Not sure what to think still. 

edit: hey I just found this.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/mit-expert-claims-latest-chemical-100819428.htmlAh got ya.Hahah nice try MSNBC.Okay. I guess you missed the part where I said that if they are doing that then they are violating the law. If someone does those things they become a criminal. Murder is illegal too but people still do that too. Where it becomes an issue is **LEGALLY CONDONED SLAVERY**. If we could just wave a magic wand and make that shit go away we would, but criminals do criminal things. My point is that the people trading slave now in Libya are not criminals under sharia law, because slavery is allowed and condoned under sharia.At $200 dollars a slave it's almost like they are just giving them away. There is not one single white majority country in the world where slavery is legal or even happening at all. Anyone exploiting another human being is violating the law that was written most likely by a white person or people. So yes, we have effectively ended it short of wiping radical Islam from the face of the planet.We didn't? I guess it was a person of color that wrote the emancipation proclamation.White farmers? No, they didn't for the most part, unless they were farming commercially, such as cotton production. Those people were not farmers, they were rich assholes who realized they could capitalize from the slave trade. The vast majority of whites in America rejected owning slaves, or simply could not afford to do so.That guy is a dick.#**WALNUT SAUCE. HATIAN SPECIAL.**He says : Here is someone I'm about to kill.

Even if we capture or kill everyone around that kid, he still has the words and ideas of radical Islam forever imprinted on his mind.The enemy literally do not give a fuck about their own children. They are just meat puppets of the Islam machine. They strap them with bombs to become martyrs. Sometimes they even tell them that the bombs will blow everyone else up, but that they will be okay.

/s>TRUE STORIES

KEK.The sad part is that comment got almost 500 upvotes?Imagine when they find that out that Hillary opposed gay marriage just a few short years ago publicly. Oh they just simply forgot about that one, but Chick-fil-A is the devil.Pretty much.http://imgur.com/a/8uMv0Migrants in Germany have committed 142,500 crimes in just six months, police figures have revealed. This was the equivalent of 780 crimes a day - an increase of nearly 40 percent over 2015, according to data from Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office.

While many governments collect exhaustive data of crime trends to measure public safety, Sweden refuses to disclose any statistics on crime committed by immigrants in the country. The last time statistics on immigrant crime were collected in Sweden was over a decade ago in 2005.
Do you even know the methodology used in that study? Those numbers in the study are curious considering the FBI's broad definition of terrorism. What was the duration of the study?

The study is based on the number of those killed by each group since 9/11. It skews the results by leaving out 9/11: what possible justification can there be for leaving 9/11 out of what is supposed to be a calculation of the magnitude of various threats to the U.S. Adherents to the belief system that led to 9/11 are still very much around. This article says that 48 people have been killed by right-wing extremists, versus 26 by Islamic jihadists, but the results would look much different if one adds one more day to the period surveyed, September 11, 2001. Then you have 3,003 people killed by Islamic jihadists, versus 48 by supposed right-wing extremists. Which is the bigger threat again?

The study also ignores the many, many foiled jihad plots. If even a fraction of them had succeeded, no one would dare make this equivalence, for even without adding in 9/11, the number of casualties of the jihad would be much higher.

Also left out that equation are the Boston marathon:

>While the Boston marathon bombings were horrific, a top terrorism expert says that the Boston attack was more like Columbine than 9/11, and that the bombers are “murderers not terrorists”.

And the Pulse nightclub shooting. And San Bernardino. Also, this is really a comparison between the threat posed by Islamic jihadists and that presented by not actual right-wing extremists, but everyone else. For there is no ideological kinship between Dylann Roof, the murderer in Charleston, South Carolina, who really was a racist lunatic, and Oregon shooter Chris Harper Mercer who had none of the Confederate paraphernalia or race hatred that Roof had. The only thing they had in common was that they both targeted Christians. They are not part of any movement with an articulated agenda or goal. Islamic jihadists, on the other hand, have a shared belief system with clearly defined goals. They are members of or ideologically aligned with groups that have declared their intention to destroy the U.S. and the free world. Islamic jihad groups are determined to kill as many Americans as possible and conquer free societies. There is no comparable “right-wing extremist” movement determined to subvert, destroy and replace the U.S. government.
 Is it? Please point to the exact verse in the Quran that says that.I'm not condoning anything they are doing. They do exist, but honestly they are not acting very Christ-like. They are not following the teachings of Christianity, and nowhere in the New Testament is any of those things condoned.The Old Testament got thrown out after Christ came. The Old Testament does not apply. Find something terrible from the New Testament and we can talk.No equivalency here. Muslims are commanded by their book to kill the non believers. Period. The reason you can even say this shit and not be killed for it is because you were raised in a society that enshrined Judaeo-Christian values. I understand the aversion to religion as I am not religious myself, but at least I can recognize where my freedom and values come from and how starkly they contrast with the values of Islam. I personally know quite a few Muslims, and they are good people. I just see what their religion actually says, and it's fucking awful.When jinns are called "fire spirits" it does not refer to their current nature, rather to their origin. Hmmmm.

So I'm not really feeling this conversation any more. If you want to defend Islam then you are an idiot. I love all people, even Muslims and idiots like yourself. But Islam is the devil and needs to be eradicated from the face of the earth. The people are cool though.That's bullshit. I've studied Islam extensively. Have you?

>All religions have their idiots 

That's true. But how often do Christian idiots and Jewish idiots kill lots of people in terrorist attacks? Not very. Not saying it has never happened, but rarely.I see you are still looking at things through your western lens. What a lot of people do not understand about the Christian bible is that the events contained within are mostly historical accounts of what happened, not condoning bad behavior.

>I'm not sure where you get the "Christianity is peaceful" biz, you must not have read the Old Testament.

The Old Testament was brutal indeed. According to Christianity Jesus was god in human form and he came to earth directly to change that. Jesus was the true inspiration for peace. Jesus was considered by Christians to be the perfect man, a worthy person to emulate as best as possible. Contrast the way that Jesus lived as is recorded and go try to reconcile that with the teachings of Mohammad and see how that goes. Did you know that Islam is the religion of men **and** demons? It says so in the Quran.

“Say (O’ Muhammed): It has been revealed to me that a group of Jinn listened and said; ‘Indeed we have heard a marvelous Quran.  It guides unto righteousness so we have believed in it, and we will never make partners with our lord’.”(Quran 72:1-2)http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/727263/Angela-Merkel-migrant-crisis-worsens-as-Germany-descends-into-lawlessness

They will release the full report in June.Of course they do. They have the book written by god himself with all the answers, remember?You are looking at this through the lens of western society and values. I know this because I just recently changed my opinion about Islam drastically because I did a lot of research into Islam and what it really is and what it really tells people to do. You do understand that Muslims believe that the Quaran was written by Allah himself and is therefore beyond question? This is very true and as such Muslims are prohibited from questioning any aspect of it or picking and choosing which parts to follow and which to ignore. This is in stark contrast to Christianity or Judaism which encourage critical thought and most of all they teach peace and coexistence. This is something that Islam is infamous for. They do NOT want to peacefully coexist. They are actively seeking to make the entire world Islamic and under Sharia law. This is what their book commands them to do and they will do it eventually unless we can stop it now before it's too late.

The last time statistics on immigrant crime were collected in Sweden was over a decade ago in 2005.Do you even know what your own book commands you to do? Do you believe that the Quran was written by god himself? Are you Sunni or Shia? Do you know any of the following terms: Kafir, taqiyya or jizya? I can give literally dozens/hundreds of examples of Muslims behaving like real shitheads, but nothing they are doing is forbidden by their religion. In fact a lot of Muslims are under the impression that if something is not strictly forbidden by the Quran that it would be wrong to  forbid it, such a child marriage. Do you deny that there are hundreds of millions of people out there who subscribe to this form of Islam? Are they not REAL Muslims?

Also, do you believe in the end times prediction of the Quran that says that in the end that the world will be entirely Islamic under Sharia law? www.geoengineeringwatch.orgI have kids so that thing would be trash on day 1 if I got one.Yeah I thought this was an old story.

No what I see is that Obama spent more than money than any president before and increased our national debt by 8 trillion dollars, and you are pissed about his travel and security expenses? Maybe if people quit threatening him and his family security costs might drop a bit.Trump did request an additional $54 billion for defense spending which is a lot of money, but personally I feel like this is currently a good move considering the state of the world today. ISIS is a major threat to our security and I applaud his efforts to keep our country safe from terrorism.This is stupid.Okay I just looked into it a bit more. Here is the scoop. This info is before Trump increased spending by $54 billion:

"Today President Barack Obama sent Congress a proposed budget request of $582.7 billion in discretionary budget authority to fund the Department of Defense in Fiscal Year 2017 (FY 2017).

The FY 2017 budget of $582.7 billion complies with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, giving the department both funding stability and protection from the damage of sequestration in FY 2016 and FY 2017.  Within the confines of this negotiated amount, the budget request reflects the priorities necessary for our force today and in the future to best serve and protect our nation in a rapidly changing security environment.  The base budget of $523.9 billion includes an increase of $2.2 billion over the FY 2016 enacted budget of $521.7 billion.  As specified in the budget agreement, DoD’s FY 2017 overseas contingency operations budget is $58.8 billion, nearly the same as the FY 2016 enacted level of $58.6 billion. The combined request represents a total increase of $2.4 billion, or less than one percent over FY 2016 enacted levels.

The FY 2017 budget reflects recent strategic threats and changes that have taken place in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.  Russian aggression, terrorism by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and others, and China’s island building and claims of sovereignty in international waters all necessitate changes in our strategic outlook and in our operational commitments.  Threats and actions originating in Iran and North Korea negatively affect our interests and our allies.  These challenges have sharpened the focus of our planning and budgeting."

So about 637 Billion. Seems legit.

 Remind me in 4 years! I want to compare and contrast the 2 after Trump completes his 4 years vs Obama's first 4 years. I bet you will see big differences in how the money is spent, but ultimately can he spend as much while in office as Obama?

"The national debt grew the most dollar-wise during President Obama's two terms. He added $7.917 trillion, a 68 percent increase, in seven years. This was the fifth-largest increase percentage-wise and the largest increase in real dollars. Obama's budgets included the economic stimulus package. It added $787 billion by cutting taxes, extending unemployment benefits, and funding public works projects. The Obama tax cuts added $858 billion to the debt in two years.

Obama's budget increased defense spending to between $700 billion and $800 billion a year. Federal income was down, thanks to lower tax receipts from the 2008 financial crisis. He also sponsored the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It was designed to reduce the debt by $143 billion over ten years. But these savings didn't show up until the later years. For more, see National Debt Under Obama."

Edit: All these downvotes but no one is disputing the facts. Guess you guys don't give a flying fuck about all the bad shit he did. Guess he made you feel good, and that is what is really important.  /sSource for the 600 billion figure? Seems excessive.None yet unfortunately. We need to get a team on the ground to test to determine the exact substance. Initial reports suggest sarin gas, but until testing happens we won't know for sure.Yeah because then ISIS wouldn't have them and millions of people would still be alive and the region would probably be stable.He increased military spending to help combat the threat of ISIS. Maybe overkill, but better than underestimating your enemy.If it was sarin it would have to be delivered by fixed wing aircraft. Only Assad and the Russians are using those, so unless this was an accident on the ground during transportation, it would presumably be one of those 2 parties because their enemies do no possess aircraft.The constitution only applies to US citizens, therefore completely constitutional as the US constitution only applies to legal US citizens. I'm not saying that illegals don't have any rights under our constitution, but that the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause does not apply to non-citizens. The rights of illegals in the US are as follows:

There is a particularly important provision of the Fourteenth Amendment stating that, "No state shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."

An undocumented immigrant is definitely a "person." In brief, this means that you are owed such procedural rights as a jury trial and the right to defend yourself against the charges if arrested; and if someone sues you over a civil matter, that you have the right to receive notice and to defend yourself in court.

Various criminal charge-related amendments to the Constitution (including the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and 14th) also apply. These protect undocumented immigrants against unlawful search and seizure by law enforcement authorities (without probable cause and a warrant for such an action) and against self-incrimination.

Undocumented immigrants have the right to file lawsuits, such as discrimination suits, in federal court. State laws vary, but some jurisdictions give an undocumented immigrant the right to sue in state court, as well.http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/20/news/companies/trump-forbes-net-worth/God this guy is such an arrogant douche.Tolerance.

It seems to me that feminism kind of started that way, but then progressed into complete hysteria about white people and males, and white heterosexual males in particular. Even in mainstream feminism you see splinters of these extreme ideas grafting themselves into their ideologies to where now we have 50 versions of feminism with their own ideas about what rape is, about what misogyny is, and about what oppression is. We have mainstream feminists encouraging tolerance for Islam in the name of being culturally sensitive, without any real understanding of the religion or the laws that they make that enshrine the subjugation of women and call for punishment for a variety of offenses for something as little as showing your face in public, or even driving.So you are telling me and everyone else with a straight face that every single thing I said were lies and untrue?
