In what way is DNA evidence found in the field not useful? Do you have studies? 

Fingerprint identification was developed in the late 1800's. Considering advancement in all areas of science, it wouldn't be surprising that it is relied on less as other methods with a smaller false positive rate are found though studies have found a [false positive rate of about 0.1%](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/19/7733.full).Beautiful bike and that is a very impressive weld job on the exhaust.Isn't that like saying medicine was founded on shaky science? It was at one point, but as we progressed and developed better practices and understood it more, that changed.

DNA evidence in the article you quote IS forensic science, that gets affected as well.You were shifting way too early for that bike.

[Given the amount of money pouring into Democrat coffers](http://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/03/27/flipthe6th-democrat-emerges-clear-leader-race-prices-seat) and Trump numbers being down, it's likely an empty threat, but on the flip side he has the media structure of the far right which talk directly to the people that vote for Freedom Caucus candidates and anyone who crosses him gets run through that media grinder.

Only a politician would come with this argument and I find it sad. Almost every scientist I know follows strict procedures and evidence regardless of political belief. Do they make mistakes, of course, they're human, but few to none actually work to benefit anyone politically. To think there is a enormous conspiracy to politicize climate change from a scientist standpoint is folly.Dr. Mann really took one for the team. Baffling to me. If 97 out of a 100 structural engineers said a bridge was unsafe, would anyone be arguing about the lack of consensus or the inability to define the exact moment it was going to fail?Better yet, a teaching moment on spotting the difference between pseudoscience and real evidence.Very nice!

“I should point out, nevertheless, that even though incomplete data can lead to a false picture, this is far different from the (false) picture obtained by those who choose to ignore empirical data to invent a picture of reality . . ."
--Lawrence KraussStory of my motorcycle life too. Every bike I've had has been my favorite by far other than that one . . .I don't know the original source as it wasn't cited. I found it here:

https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/1410.Lawrence_M_Krauss?page=2

Found this quote from him, which is now tagged as a favorite for me as well:

“I should point out, nevertheless, that even though incomplete data can lead to a false picture, this is far different from the (false) picture obtained by those who choose to ignore empirical data to invent a picture of reality (young earthers, for example), or those who instead require the existence of something for which there is no observable evidence whatsoever (like divine intelligence) to reconcile their view of creation with their a priori prejudices, or worse still, those who cling to fairly tales about nature that presume the answers before questions can even be asked."“The one thing that I want every single child to have experienced at some point in their life, as part of their education, is to have some idea they hold to be true, and at the very basis of their being, proved to be wrong.

Because that opens your mind to the realization that the world is different than you thought it would be, and you have to begin to open your mind to the possibilities of existence.

And opening your mind frees you, it doesn't constrain you. It makes the world more wonderful, more exciting, and more worth living in.”

http://www.trumptwitterarchive.comThe legality of publishing the leaks is debatable, the leak itself definitely came from an illegal source.

What I used to think they were: an anonymous whistle blower site where information could be disclosed without fear of retribution.

What they are now is up for debate. There are a couple of things that clinched my opinion of them of having an agenda. WARNING below is opinion:

1) The manner and timing that they released the DNC email information. It was completely unnecessary and dripped for dramatic effect.

2) They only seem to release information that help the agenda of one side of American politics. I find it hard to believe that only the groups on one side have information leaking to Wikileaks especially when other news sources are finding items to report on.

3) The complete lack of attention the current administration gives to release of American intelligence info yet they scream like children about leaks when their info is in the news.

4) The misinformation they release as conclusions with the information. For instance, their press release states that a group in the CIA was collecting a substantial library of attack techniques and malware and from such could launch a 'false flag' attack. First off, every cyber organization in the world collects this information and shares the fingerprints so they all have that supposed 'capability'. Secondly, the press release makes it could like this is as easy as knowing the fingerprint and having the malware. It isn't. In a conventional war, it would be the equivalent of crossing enemy lines, avoiding detection by them, dressing as them, using their weapons to attack your own people, then cross back leaving no trace, and not getting caught.[This video hits it for me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84Jehn4ZsGY) Just like going . . . everywhere man.I used uship last year with good results for a long distance move.

True, but that's a jump in conclusion at this point. There's no evidence that any of these tools were used on American citizens though it is being strong implied by Wiki.

> with the explicit ability (and policy) of planting false evidence trails

There is no policy and the ability is weak. Wikileaks jumped to the conclusion that since they maintain a database of known malware they could do this. Every nation state, foreign cyber unit, malware company, and forensic investigation unit in the world maintain malware databases. If it were that easy, you'd have seen a ton of 'stuxnet' attacks blamed on the US. First, they are used for fingerprinting not framing. Second, they make it sound like 'framing' a nation state is easy and all they need is a proxy, some IP hops, and this malware. That's TV not reality, that's like saying all you need is the murder weapon to make a crime look like someone else. See links below, they go into some of the methods.

Read my comment in [context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor) of the thread. Those were two hypothesis, obviously one is too far out there to be worthy of following, the other easier. Doesn't mean I'm making the claim to have proof or denial of either.Who said I claimed anything?Ha, true, but in this case I was being serious. I think that's why it breezed by the press.

Either:

The CIA is part of a deep state which is out to undermine true American values which there has never been any evidence of. The CIA then using their highly sophisticated tool set hatch a plan to undermine the election, but in this case, they were being doubly smart by not going after the obvious threat to them, but would go after the candidate they actually want. They would do so by posing as Russia, but only in a fashion that wasn't obvious enough for everyone except the cyber community to agree on and they would leak the information through a source that would adamantly deny any connection to the nation state the CIA was trying to frame. Despite their craftiness in completing the hack, they were unable to control the distribution of the weaponized tool sets they use, but were able to hide the evidence of them actually performing said hack.
