I don't need one. They're a joke. And no, they should be funding public hospitals, rail, schools, universities, etc and breaking down the class deviation.

If they were serious about defense, why don't we have a missile program and just hit whatever is deemed as a threat from far away? Why don't we have AUS made subs and Navy? What fkn super? I'm nearly 30 and I have under 50k, which doesn't even cover the fkn depositDidnt realise the Fun Pimps subscribed to Valve time...Im a "what if" doomsday prepper tinfoilhat subscriber.

But in honesty, when 58% of the populace is saying we have a problem with housing affordability, and the CEO going "nah nah its fine" (see CBA ATM polls), lending to anyone and everyone they can in a deregulated market, guess what they're going to do when they can no longer sell a repo'd crack house (see the shoebox in Sydney that sold 1.4m) to cover at least 80% of the loan?Jesus tap dancing Christ, how stupid can this government get when it comes to spending our taxes?? 

Instead of being in countries we don't belong, how about we pull our Diggers and spend that on fucking infrastructure that was build in the 70s???When is it due?Or a farm deep underground with zero light or water produces 4 crops lolPrecisely.Is it going to be opened?Great job NSW gormit! /SHaha, good ok Kthulu!Wait, an actual fkn tank??

/TinfoilhatDon't matter. With the population density they have, even one could amount to hundreds if not thousands deadUntil they're not. And millions of people die>Trump has previously threatened unilateral action against Pyongyang if China -- the North's sole major ally -- fails to help curb its neighbour's nuclear weapons ambitions.

>But Pyongyang's response suggested the reclusive state is determined to continue on its current path, despite repeated rounds of United Nations sanctions.

>"We will take the toughest counteraction against the provocateurs in order to defend ourselves by powerful force of arms," the foreign ministry spokesman said.

>"We will hold the US wholly accountable for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its outrageous actions."

I am not very familiar with US foreign policy, however would like to know who would answer for the crimes when (not if) the North is near defeat, and in a final defiance launches strikes against Soul or Tokyo?

In closing, from the article:

>While a US unilateral strike on North Korea from a shorter range might be more effective, it would likely endanger many civilians in the South and risk triggering a broader military conflict, experts warn.Hey at least ur in the opposite direction of the rushWhat sorry of friends do you have mate??Confrontation with the north will be bad for everyone. Sure the US will win, but think what will happen when they realise it's game overCan you guys help me pollinate my indoor Cannabaceae plant? The instructions said it should flower by now, but am not seeing results :(That happens in the public sector as well> The world has always and will always be like this.

Instant wipe of Bofors> Plus you get zeroing artillery which is decent on enemy sectors.

That thing is OP as fuck and doesnt even require you to have sight.Calling L2P here OP. Pfuseliers get raped by quad mount and even a t70I agree. This is why we need AR15's and .50 revolvers to be legalised! /sI'm not even going to warrant a thorough response to someone who fails to use proper punctuation. The a in American is a capital. Good dayThere you go again, making everything about America...

World news is exactly that, world news; if I wanted American news I'd turn on CNN. Article is published by a UK company covering world's and US relationship, which any tension will seriously impact more than just the of America. I
