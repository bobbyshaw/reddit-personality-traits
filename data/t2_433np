It is, but you don't get to build a huge PR campaign about the "science of Arrival" or the "science of Interstellar". The problem here is the contrast between the advertisement (solid science, guys!) and the delivery (magical language and time travelling love & gravity)./r/PropagandaPosters silently deletes all comments that partially match a long list of "low quality" expressions, including:

> "science bitch(es)?", "(yo)?u monster", "Came here to say this", "challenge accepted", "read that as", "Lost it at", "feels good man", "seems legit", "you can'?t explain that", "You(\.|,)?

They're all bad. The entire concept of labelling text as "verboten" without a human in the loop is wrong.

So you don't really need hard sci-fi to enjoy something. You need a smart author.

That said, "Ex Machina" was very interesting, while keeping bullshit to a minimum and "Robot and Frank" is the perfect example of sci-fi staying in the background, because the script writers know how to give their characters emotional depth and tell a story without relying on gimmicks.> if academic rigor was a necessity for science fiction, 100% of every movie or book in the genre would have to be thrown out

It's not supposed to be realistic. It's "Homeland" brought to the highest levels of artistic expression. Think Donna Summer's "I feel love" - we don't like it because of its genre, but because of Moroder's genius arangement.

So just like you can hate disco and still appreciate that song, you should be able to hate the blatant rewriting of history and still appreciate "The Americans".> like we're now talking about Twin Peaks

I think "The Leftovers" will fill that spot.> amazing cast, amazing writing and amazing soundtrack

All true, but what makes it transcend its original purpose as a Homeland-style propaganda piece is the acting and the direction.

What was supposed to be one CIA agent's fantasy about superhuman Russian spies that were at the same time sleepers and active enough to justify American incompetence, became a work of art.

Keri Russel and Matthew Rhys go above and beyond their duty as TV show protagonists and pull off consistent performances that take those characters from ridiculous caricatures to complex and believable humans. Their portrayal of internal turmoils is fascinating and unusual in the TV landscape (see "Allegiance" for a run-of-the-mill take on the subject).

Nobody is surprised that Frank Langella or esteemed character actress Margo Martindale have above average performances, but having most of the cast rise to the same level is truly impressive. I blame the directors for that (most of them are also executive producers).Free speech is a right for humans, not bots.This is cinematographic rickrolling.

The film is only noticeable for its deadpan absurdity mixed with a classic rom-com recipe, but it fails to do anything else with it. There's no actual art here, no poetry, no philosophy. Just farts and gay necrophilia.To understand why this is relevant, you need to know that there are more than 80 million Evangelicals in US (in a population of 324 millions).
