Admittedly I didn't look up when it came out.  It's still 21 years so yeah, not sure what your point is other than getting your jollies from correcting someone online. Oh wait I forgot this is Reddit, I'm surprised my grammar wasn't corrected too.  She was being violent but OP selectively chose what facts to consider to paint the picture they want others to see.  If that picture fits readers political predisposition, they are more likely to believe it.  Then they accuse T_D of doing the same thing.  It's called projection. "innocent" female protester was throwing bottles and wore weighted gloves, an illegal weapon in the state of California.  'proven' - - that's funny.  That whole sub is brain cancer for those who think logically. Movie is like 30 years old? They do the same shit in Texas.  It's just a bogus excuse to get you pulled over so they can dig for the $$$ offenses. About the same cost? Lol suddenly /r/politics narrative switches again.  Sweet we're totally OK with foreign governments meddling in our elections, just only UK spies surveilling US citizens on behalf of Obama.  Totally not for political gain though! Totally gaaaaaaaaaaay! Level up into an alienThe diety of diets?  Good to know the highland charge is alive and wellThis 'nazi' punches back! Except she wasn't raped and murdered like if it was 👳☪️6 million Smart car won't do too much damage Like BerniebrosTrue.  Seems Ben and Bill have something in common...? Copy pasted from articleBUY MOAB AND MAKE ISIS PAYAs a Cowboys fan, I try to like others in the offseason at least. At the very least fake hate crimes outnumber real ones.  Let that sink in for a second A half assed coup was the best thing Erdogan could have hoped for.  Now he's purged the government and consolidated more power than ever.  It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precious good, whose delicate complex of order and freedom, culture and peace, can at any moment be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within.

Sweden / Germany / France / Belgium / UK please please wake up before it's too late! It's actually not free if you pay for it. It's not just Saudi Arabia.  Look at most Muslim majority countries.  There's a reason many people don't want to import large numbers of people from those countries, and it has nothing to do with race or any other -ism or phobia.  It's that we don't want their crazy in our society, and that those people integrate poorly. It was a goldmine either way the election had goneNope still faggotThere already was a civil war over this. You mean the Muslims? LolJewish meganerd KEKSo much fake news desperately trying to pander to the hysterical anti-Trump camps. Their confirmation bias is so bad they will believe literally anything that fits their narrative. How about everyone pays less and we have a less powerful and pervasive government? Do they not understand that Palestinians do not have the same privilege as Israelis because THEY ARE STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM?  They have a shit life because they FUCKING ELECTED HAMAS!   Ass-imilated! No you're right illegal isn't criminal.  Legal genius herwLol man you are delusional as fuck. If you illegally immigrate to a country that makes you a criminal.  It's that simple.  Criminal law is violation of statute.  Civil law is totally different.  Do YOU even law bro? I have an idea!  Let's get tons of them to move to western countries and they will just magically assimilate! There is so much national beauty in this great nation.  I'm thankful for people like you who appreciate it.  Thank you for having enough respect for our country to follow the legal immigration and naturalization process, you will make a model citizen! Illegal immigration is INHERENTLY A CRIMINAL MATTER! 🛩️💣🏴☪️👳💕🐐


🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Didn't she meet with Bill Clinton (rapist) in an airport right before Comey recommended no charges for Hillary? 🍇🍇OFF WITH HIS CONGRESSIONAL SEAT!  RECALL ELECTION! Just shows that America has the best people.  She was wrong about everything. 
But why am I not 50 points ahead, you may ask? After how this last season ended, yeah probably so... Lol @ temporary ptsd.  Fuckin cuck doesn't deserve to use that term.  Our real heros suffer the cost of what they've endured protecting our freedom.   May God bless them, we owe them so much. Then lots of other times without their consent, but that doesn't make it rape! OUT OUT OUT CANCER! I thought if you supplied a gun to a person knowing they were going to use it in a crime, you can be charged as well?  Why wasn't Holder charged as an accessory to 1st degree murder? Muy caliente! But muh hope and muh change! ... With Walnut sauce and pizza for dessert? 
👬🔞🍕🍕Wait but Trump is a known sexist, why would he hire a woman for an important job like that? /sWeakMinistry of Truth|<€|<Duck banana, sidestep and grab em right by the pussyOh no that sucks They are led by pied piper shills, and their confirmation bias keeps them gobbling up all the poison they're spoonfed by fake news. So true and liberals have engineered the social and educational programs which fostered the dependency that keeps blacks in their current socioeconomic position. Yeah me too, proud to have an 88 hoodie for this BASED badass. 

Ps it wasn't a catch (it was) Wow they have assimilated so well! (they havent) When punchy keeps perv from reoffending, I'll take that second wrong if it means there's not a third, fourth, and fifth. Curse of the Chappelle Show strikes again!  

RIP funny man =(I'm totally good with free ID, even if it means a national ID card.  I understand poll tax, and agree that it is wrong and illegal.  

Voter ID is just common sense.  The motive behind many of the opponents of voter ID are questionable at best, and the harms touted are pretty damn thin at best.  My whole point, since we're being reasonable, is that it isn't expensive or difficult, and aguing that it is a REAL BARRIER is a joke.  And you know it.  Be a grown up, learn about voter requirements, and satisfy them before voting. 

You think any of these bullshit excuses people make for those 'harmed' by Voter ID laws would hold up in court to defend someone who didn't file their taxes?  Exactly. Pass laws to ban guns cause criminals will follow laws!! 
🤣🤣Sounds like

NookyLol wow lol 16 bucks every 5-10 years lol what lol a lol fucking lol joke lol you are lol a lol sad lol human lol being lol that lol needs lol a lol hug lol or lol something lol 
LOL Edit: lol @ LOL This is who the students are paying tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition to have teach them.  What a joke Exactly what was done in 1984.  Winston reported his parents if I remember correctly... Lol u couldn't afford $10 to get an ID?  This is so asinine, it's obvious that your affordability argument is clutching straws.  Maybe check in at /r/personalfinance so you can avoid not having $10 for something pretty important.  How much did you spend on the device that you're posting to Reddit on?  Or the service for it?

Also absolutely none of the replies actually supported the judge's "legal reasoning" as to how the law specifically is in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  It's to prove residency, AKA that you're legitimately entitled to in-state benefits.  I was just in Oklahoma and I would have had to prove residency to buy a fishing license at the in-state rate.  And you can get government issued ID cards (non drivers license) for less hassle and the cost is $11 for renewal or $16 for a new.  If you want to vote, regardless of race, Hey you might want to go get a fucking card months in advance, and cough up the $11-$16 bucks.  I paid $35 for my 6 day out of state Oklahoma fishing license. 

Let's be completely frank and honest at this point, who the hell, as an adult, doesn't have an ID card at least at this point?  What the fuck?  I mean, really? You have to have ID to legally drive. To fly through airports. To legally enter or reenter the country. To enter a bar or liquor store. To enter a club. To purchase medicines or various products including alcohol and cigarettes, or pornography.  To get a loan. To open a bank account. To do all sorts of various things in life as a halfway decent productive member of society.  And to make a case that you shouldn't have to make a basic attempt to prove who you are when you vote is fucking asinine and every one of you downvoters know it.  Stop clinging to issues you can make "racist" in attempt for political gain.  Aka the media tries to suppress anything that could make Islam look bad. These days they are working around the clock. Don't depend on external positivity for your internal positivity. Look at Trump during the election. SO MUCH negativity from the MSM, even many Republicans fighting tooth and nail against him.  He fought back and triumphed.  You've shown you can do the same, and get back on top of life. 

Stay strong and keep up the good work, we will need veterans like you in the Great Meme War of 2020.  MAGALoretta Lynch met Bill Clinton secretly in a plane the day before no charges recommended by FBI and just now you people are worried about DOJ being politicized?  LOOOOOOLSo people want higher taxes? Lol fuuuuuuck no.  And how can you upvote that idea in April? Illegal aliens, not immigrants Lol how is it "discrimatory intent" to keep felons and illegal Mexicans from voting in Texas elections?   Law requires ID to buy rubber cement or cigarettes, but not to cast a ballot to participate in government? Aka downvote T_D with their bot armyThey're busy right now 🚛🚛🚛Cuz that's totally what fascists do, shrink government and take power from their own Administration... Aha!  They should just only hire Muslims to drive their delivery trucks!  Problem solved!  (it's not) 🍇🍇🤔😂.... But black people can't be racist? ABSOLUTELY HARAMFine with that. Driving traffic to a very partisan site like ShareBlue which is Correct the Record 2.0 is terrible.  They admitted to employing tons of people to post and comment on Reddit to create a false sense of pro-Hillary popular support. Looks like almost halfway decent mustard at that.  Lol @ ShareBlue link.  "politics" not neutral at all. Should just be /r/Democrats because this sub is anything but neutral Thanks for the insight, I'm certainly not an expert.  My thought was that federal jurisdiction for hate crimes came from back when some 'Jim crow' states still weren't prosecuting people for racially motivated crimes, so the feds assumed jurisdiction.  

As always I appreciate the discussion. I was under the impression that anything that is deemed a hate crime falls under Federal jurisdictionMe too man, wrap your shirt around a hand to be a basic shield, juke out / deflect his first swing then close the distance so he can't swing again, grapple to the ground, move to a choke hold and choke him till he's out.  Then fuckin remove kebab.    

Even if you fail, at least it buys the girl enough time to run to safety and get help.  Either way, this is why I never camp without having my pistol with me.  Fuck countries where it is illegal to defend yourself. Just got back from Oklahoma and had to admit I wish there had been a better historical reconciliation between USFG and the nations. 

That being said, I drove past Choctaw Casino and I couldn't help but notice the irony that nows it's the NAs giving the white man firewater and cheating them out of their money LOL.  How ironic and a propos! 

But yes there needs to be a way to ween the nations off the federal teat.  Maybe legalize weed and let the Indian nations grow and sell it to distributers tax-free.  It would give them an advantage over the rest of domestic producers in an emergent market. Maybe a Rwandan with a machete thoughCause she's married to an executive producer of MSNBC, right?

🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🍕It doesn't take very many terrorists to cause a lot of damage.  Look at Bataclan, or Nice, Belgium, Sweden, Berlin...  While they may not be "refugees" radical Islamic groups have actively been infiltrating under the refugee guise.  They may not have struck yet, but they are there.  The logic of "well it hasn't happened yet to me so it must not be true" really doesn't hold a lot of water.  Maybe I should keep smoking cigarettes because it hasn't given me cancer yet?  The problem is once you realize you're wrong, it's too late. RIP brave soulJust deport and quarantine them all in their own shit hole countries and let them kill each other like they've been doing for thousands of years.  Cheaper than wasting our expensive bullets and missiles on goatherders. Damn Farewell to Arms was a tough book to digest emotionally.  I'll never forget having my heart ripped out by that last chapter I have more sympathy for the poor dog that got rabies.  They didn't choose that fate. Terrorists made a choice
