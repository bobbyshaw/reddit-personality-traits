Why wouldn't all applications function properly if you run Android on your pc?Well isolation isn't healthy. In Scandinavia you get stigmatized if you're smoking cannabis. A lot of people experience naming and shaming once a rumor gets going, and it's not always easy to find acceptance from families or the people you thought were your friends. They don't want to be associated with people using drugs and can go to great lengths to make you feel bad about yourself in hope you'll quit, ironically they consume large amounts of alcohol in the weekends themselves like they're unable to see the contradiction in doing so.  

The general lack of legal recreational substances in the world is excluding hundreds of million people that don't enjoy the taste or feeling alcohol gives, from experiencing the same wellbeing alcohol consumers get when they're disconnecting from their everyday lives in the weekends. This isn't a Scandinavian problem specifically, but the low population spread over large areas is already setting its mark on the social norms, and if you want to live your life a little bit differently than the rest, especially if you live outside the suburbans, it can make the world feel a lot smaller than it already does which is definitely a Scandinavian specific problem.  

This stigma, social exclusion and personal attacks from society and everyone around you causes a lot of cannabis users in Scandinavia to isolate themselves and cut out friends in order to live life as they chose, and thus the norm is a lot of them tend to isolate themselves and are forced to deal with the mental health issues living a isolated life for long periods brings with it, usually with everyone around them who made them feel bad about themselves sitting on their high horses saying "I told you so, cannabis is bad for you" once that lifestyle has taken its toll. First of all: Did you get the part where I mentioned "probably" multiple times? Yes, that indicates I am not making anything up in terms of putting words in to his mouth. It's called assumptions, and it is based on the severity of the situation he describes. A calculated assumption using reasoning as a tool to conclude a conclusion. Do you even posess any reasonable reasoning skills? 

Secondly: if we're talking about addiction which is what this post is about, you don't prioritize LoL over your family members unless you're actually ADDICTED, let's get that out of the way.

So unless you understand what you're reading which I adressed in my first point, and you're able to apply that level of depth in to  an analyzation zon't reply with ignorance. Either ask the poster to expand or explain what you're unsure of or don't comment at all. I don't think you fully grasp what being addicted to a game actually means. You're talking about playing games responsible. If that was the case this guy would never have written a lengthy post about how it consumed his life and got more important than his family members. We're not on the same page at all. The background of his story witness of a person who played a lot more than a few casual hours a day and a bit more in the weekends. Once he got addicted, he probably played every hour available, probably ditched friends and other social stuff for the sake of gaining LP, as well as probably calling in sick at school or work to play League. That's when we can start talking about addiction, and when a hobby no longer is a hobby. You might think that's perfectly fine as long as the person involved is happy doing so, but I beg to differ. I've been there myself and despite being at the most depressive stage of my life, I was convinced gaming was the best thing I had to hold on to. Truth is it was the root to a lot of the problems holding me back. Either you're a bit in denial yourself or you're completely misunderstanding where I'm coming from and the problem isn't that we disagree, but like I said, we're not even on the same page. Gaming is fine, never said it wasn't. I love gaming.And again I ask you, why have you decided he only played 2 hours a day since then? Like a lot of people they might start off by barely playing, taking long breaks from the game or even finding it difficult to get "into" until they learn what all the other champions, items and consumables do and start developing skills, which can take a looong time in a game like League. Clearly he didn't play just 2 hours every day. A person only gaming 2 hours a day doesn't have an addiction problem, that's a pretty casual gamer. You talk about using basic math, but have you tried basic reasoning? Why have you decided he only played for 2 hours a day? His story clearly tells it was way more than that. Oh so you do it, then it's fine? Like I said I knew I was stepping on some toes with my comment. I can't help that some people will feel attacked since gaming is an addiction for so many people, for others it's all they have. Perhaps we're misunderstanding each other and you failed to see the point, this guy didn't play for fun, it took control of his life. I don't see what there is to defend about a life life like that. No one is saying you're not allowed to do it,  different strokes for different folks, but that's not a healthy situation in my opinion and if it's making you unhappy as well then what is there really to debate? Moderate yourself and especially is your hobby suddenly has turned in to a 24/7 addiction that's leading no where and getting in the way of more important priorities. I know all about that, trust me. I didn't say a degree or a lot of money is the answer to a "happy" life, although I personally believe it makes life a lot easier. My message was what ever is holding you back, change it! Stuck in a dead end job? Look for a new. Stuck in a relationship that's making you miserable? Get out of it. Has a video game taken over your life? Stop playing. What ever it is do something about it, don't just let it continue. Else I can tell you exactly how your life will be a few years from now. Pretty much the same. But this is starting to come out of context, could be a different thread imo.The moral of the story is he'd do it all over again if the love of his life was the carrot dangling at the finish line. What frustrated me wasn't how love changed his life and made it possible for him to reconcile with his poor life choices. It was the special thanks he gave to Riot and the end of his story. He could just as well be thanking God for the plans he had set out for him. All I am getting at was if what you're doing is making you miserable but you keep on doing it anyway, stop. If you continue doing the same things you've been doing up until now, and you're not happy with the direction your life is taking, stop. Change something! Or else you'll continue to get more of exactly the same. He's lucky he met someone he could fall in love with, but I'm sure if he never played League at all he'd probably meet someone else before he died as an old man, without having to deal with his guilty conscience. But I'm happy for him. I take it he's still playing League as well so he hasn't learned too much of his mistakes. Hopefully he can manage his gametime a little bit better now days.Frustrating read to be honest. Spending that much time in any game is never worth it, especially if it means you chose it over the last hours with a dying family member. It's as if you're saying "Go on then, bury your life in this game, do it! You might meet the love of your life" which is ridiculous. Truth is you could just as well have studied and got a degree in the same amount of time, got a well paid job, made a good life for yourself AND met the love of your life either at school or through work. And then you'd be sitting here writing about how quitting League was the best thing that ever happened to you. For most people spending their days living inside this game will not result in anything besides a lot of time and opportunities wasted, with nothing to show for when they're finally fed up. I don't care if I'm stepping on some toes here, I realize a lot of people have nothing else going for them besides gaming, but saying that's the kind of life you'd wish for anyone else is a bit of a stretch. Or Arch being the best and most popular distro ever.I am curious, where did you get this idea? You seem very reassured for something that's not true.Oh, you bought them all from one person.

Hands look fine.Was there seriously no information about the keyboards on craigslist, like model name? Impossible to Google any information beforehand?Finally proves paranormal stuff is real? The thing about paranormal experiences is they are real, I think we've proved that decades ago. They are real experiences inside the head of mentally ill people. And what is reality anyway? It is what we perceive it to be.But have you actually watched any reviews on this device? They crash, overheat and [warp](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/6311k9/the_nintendo_switch_is_starting_to_warp_while/) I've seen so many people complain.I wonder what this means for the Ubuntu Gnome team. I'm using their distribution myself and I'm really exited for the news, but still feel bad for the guys. Unless they're teaming up my interest to continue working on the project until 18.04 would pretty much dismantle. I recently went from years of switching between Unity, Xfce and Lxde to Gnome, couldn't be more satisfied. This is a very smart move from Canonical and it will certainly be appealing to the majority of Linux users. meh just a virgin with mommy issues. i've seen worse.Oh I do, you however don't know what you're talking about, that's why I wished you a good day. You'll have to excuse me from refusing to bang my head against yours when you can easily google it yourself. So have a nice day!Wow, just wow. Have a nice day.Have you not seen the movie [A Beautiful Mind](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/?ref_=nv_sr_1)? It's based on a true story of a mathematician who won the nobel prize in economics. Spoiler alert! > 

[John Forbes Nash Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr.) died two years ago with his wife in a car crash (age 86) and lived the majority of his life as a schizophrenic without taking medication, and instead decided to learn how to live with his illness and accept it.  

The point is John Nash like many other schizophrenics had an obsession for numbers and patterns, and it's not uncommon for schizophrenic people to be very intelligent, extremely organized and orderly. But it's not like all schizophrenic all have the same personalities, they're as unique and different from each other as any of us. You'll find just as much diversity in a room full of schizophrenics as in a room full of healthy people.    > They don't even update their kernels unless you specifically opt for it despite the **big, red, warning signs**  

Never said you couldn't get kernel updates if you opted in for it, I said you won't by default. Which you wont. And the only "good" thing about Mint is the part that is directly related to Ubuntu, you know since it's based off Ubuntu. The "Mint touch" to Ubuntu is meh. And to stick to the point, a beginner would not know how important it is to ignore the warnings Mint issues when downloading the latest kernel and security updates *making your system unstable*. Hence why it is not a very good beginner distribution.  

> Most kernel vulnerabilities are local escalations - and even then they're not easily exploitable. The average desktop user doesn't need to worry about them.  

This entire statement is just wrong. You must not have known about the CIA exploits, huh.This was my exact thought when they ported it to Linux. I'm not going to buy a game at nearly full price when it's a season behind. Try doing that with FIFA, NBA or any other sports game which stats are updated on seasonal results. F1 2015 is based on the final results from 2014, so technically the stats for all the vehicles are two season old. I'm not gonna say people would jump on the opportunity to buy this game on Linux if they ported F1 2016 when they released it, but I am saying that no other sports game which is based upon seasonal results would look attractive when it's already 1 year old.I find it weird that you say Fedora is a professional/work related distribution. It's the unstable testing ground for RHLE. Next It's weird how you give Arch, Gentoo, Slackware and LFS their own bulletpoints when they pretty much fulfill the same roles, just one do it better than the other.  

It's like you're saying Mint is an acceptable beginner distribution (but Ubuntu is not?) when it's terrible! They don't even update their kernels unless you specifically opt for it despite the big, red, warning signs for crying out loud. Not exactly what I would say beginner friendly.  

Ubuntu is more deserving of the title "beginner" distribution than Mint by miles, if you're having a problem with the Unity desktop you can easily download a Ubuntu flavor with another DE of your choice. And that's exactly the role it fulfills in the Linux world. It's just as well suited for the inexperienced as the experienced. What happened to equality? It's only important when it benefits the women huh? I see how it is.To be perfectly realistic about it, Mourinho isn't going to hold the squad together for that long. Signs are already there, and history speaks volumes. He's a two, three season wonder-maker, and I really doubt he'll be so lucky with Man Utd.I press the power button.why even play them right? just watch a few screenshots and post a review. seriously though, i addressed very one dimensioal games which are wysiwyg. it should take a little more insight to write a review than a few minutes of gametime, there's enough examples of games that seemed bad at first that turned out to be very good, and they're the perfect example of why you should have a minimum of gametime before posting reviews instead of filling up the review section with meaningless first impressions. we'll just have to agree to disagree.To be fair you couldn't even tell No Man's Sky was such an epic failure without playing it for at least two hours. You would barely have left your starting planet in that time. Aside from the launch crashes and bugs that got patched, the biggest downfall for NMS was lack of content and the disappointing ending, both that would require a few hours of gaming to realize. why would anybody want to abuse it? i don't think the very few people who would willingly buy a game, and sit inside it idle for x'amount of time just to write a negative review is worth worrying about. And they certainly don't outweigh the benefits this will have on the overall reviews.It's not about what you have to hide, it's about saying yes to privacy. Some people might actually want their government and advertisement companies to store all your history, I dunno. No idea why anybody would think that is ok.Addons that visit random websites will make your browsing history look like a mess or at lest very generic from your ISP perspective. Doing random Google searches will only make it harder for Google's search engine to guess what you're looking for. Your ISP can't actually see what you've been searching for on Google since it is https:// which goes for all websites that uses SSL encryption.big moles, inverted nipples or no hips/ass.Now you are projecting your world on to his, as if people couldn't actually have different morals than you without faking it.If https:// means your ISP will only see the website you're visiting, but not the services you're questing from that website - what point is there to ruin your google search history?I have no idea who they have in mind, but I'll be very surprised if Liverpool can snatch up £40-60m player in front of the biggest clubs around the world without them interfering. And Klopp isn't going to spend that kind of money on a big name unless he's worth it. Which makes it very unlikely we'll be the only ones placing bids. Until Liverpool wins something of importance to foreign stars we're a bit optimistic to compete with the likes of Barca, Real, Chelsea, City, or Bayern. We'd even have to get down on our knees, kiss their feet and beg them to sign if we're up against the likes of Man Utd, Arsenal, Tottenham, PSG, Atletico Madrid, Dortmund and so forth. I like the ambition, but the reality is we're still shopping from the second shelf this summer.Well that was creepy. Nothing like watching a pedophile grope a kid before you start off your day.Agreed. With his injuries and wages I can see him going for as low as £15-20m.Just split it and support both. It's not always about the size of the donation, showing your appreciation means a lot too.Well I certainly hope they do because if they referred to each other by their gamer tags in all social circumstances that would make me smirk a little bit!I find it odd they're calling each other by their gamer tags instead of their real names. They're in their 30's or just reaching it.It's not the hunting that gets him thrilled, it's the killing. "I like hunting animals" sounds a lot better than "I just enjoy killing them". When you fail so hard to get the point, being called plain stupid by *you* doesn't really mean a lot. Do they actually believe making encryption apps illegal will stop terrorists from using them? It sounds like they believe there's a magic button you can press to make things disappear from the internet. The only ones who will get their privacy violated from this are law abiding citizens.  

If a terrorist or a criminal wants to get hold of encrypted technologies, there is nothing the government can do to stop them. They are clearly technological illiterates to even suggest such a dumb idea. Sometimes I feel there should be an age limit for how old people who run our countries should be allowed to be. Maximum 45 years old sounds about right. Beyond that point they're not keeping up with the evolving - modern world, and are stuck thinking like prehistorical chimps.  Over the last 3 years I've done a lot of hopping out of sheer interest. At the moment I am very happy with the distro I have landed on and will most likely keep it permanent. I want to pass the RHCSA exam at some point, and all the time I'll have to spend in CentOS might eventually make me want to use Fedora permanently down the road. But as of now Ubuntu Gnome is the one I prefer.  

From beginning until now -->

* Linux Mint  
* Ubuntu Unity  
* Fedora  
* Tails  (Still use it)  
* Ubuntu MATE  
* Lubuntu  
* Xubuntu   
* Linux Lite  
* Puppy Tharpup  
* Ubuntu Gnome  (currently installed)  Perhaps you want to read my comment one more time instead. I never talked about them breaking any desktops. And all distributions have their history of bugs and crashes so don't pretend they're the worst of the lot, they're not. A lot of the problematic stuff with Ubuntu has been explicitly Unity related stuff which can easily be avoided by using another DE. Ubuntu is *more* than fine, Unity however is pretty much still in beta by any standard.  

As for the rest of your accusations, they don't mention Linux on their website? Wow. You're right, except if you actually navigate their website instead of just looking at the homepage, they mention Linux several times like in the [about page](https://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu). Or them cooperating with Microsoft, Google and Amazon, yes they pretty much get to put their own code in the Linux kernel, that's how bad it is /sarcasm. Newsflash Michael - Microsoft is cooperating with **all** Linux distributions in the [Linux foundation](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/16/microsoft-joins-the-linux-foundation/). Even your new beloved openSUSE. They're actually platinum members. If that's your problem I recommend moving on to a BSD derivative, or perhaps TempleOS is more up your alley. As for complaining about the library of drivers - that's generalizing on a whole new level. "Nobody cares about those"? Well ok then, thanks for representing the entire world.Wow 10 years and they mess up your phone 1 time. You're not married are you?Yes that is true, but despite not having the latest version of all packages in their repositories, in this case we're talking about Ubuntu and Debian, they still backport new security updates and ship them out. And because Mint use their own repository in addition to Ubuntu or Debian's, there's always the risk of contaminating your ecosystem with conflicting packages, causing your computer to crash or not booting at all. Hence why Mint does not recommend you updating anything besides the packages they've tested themselves, *delayed* packages and updates mind you, which is the only thing we're addressing here.  

So you're stuck in a russian roulette by either contaminating the ecosystem of your computer or having the latest security updates. This is possible to do in just about any distribution alright, and there are a few hickups now and then, but the whole point of sticking with the official repositories *only* is to eliminate this problem. And that goes for all officially supported Debian and Ubuntu distribution and flavors. Mint isn't on either list for that simple reason.That's completely up for interpretation. If you run the risk of crashing your system for using untested updates, then clearly the stuff they're providing you is held back and delayed.First he admits Mint is holding back security updates, and talks it down by mentioning you can install them at your own risk. Then in the next paragraph he denies Mint updates are delayed since they're pulled directly from Ubuntu or Debian's repositories, which is true, but because of the stability issues they're **not recommended** updates in Mint until they are tested...  

That's what the rest of us call held back, and delayed updates!  
*"Oh no, you can install anything you'd like at your own risk, but the stuff we recommend - that's postponed".*How can you relate to something you've never experienced? Sure extremely positive and optimistic people get sad too, but they deal with emotions in a completely different way. While person A would grief, look forwards and move on with their life - person B would grief, look backwards and spiral down. Person A wouldn't understand what depression really feels like. It would be the same as asking a psychopath to explain love, they're emotionally detached. The keyword in this article is *extremely* positive people. Not generally positive people. All the homophobes in this chat trying to cover up for their insecurities. You're all gay lol.Well I find people like you disgusting, no further reason behind that. I simply dislike people who discriminate others, you're no better than radical religious people. All skull and no brain.There is no difference between homophobia and racism, duh. Of course it's a hate crime.He doesn't want to be a part of the community. He wants to be on top of it, you see? Psychology. They better punish homophobia just as hard as racism, else it's hypocrisy.If you have nowhere to turn for food and shelter, I would lie and tell them you regret what you've done, say you'll work on your faith and that means you'll have to accept to their conditions as well which will be the hardest part, but the light at the end of the tunnel will be getting a job and saving up money to move out, move too far away for them to show up on your door, cut all contact for as long as you need and use that time to find your happiness. It will also give them time to digest their behavior and realize how unfairly they've treated you. If they can't respect how you want to live your life, then why should you have to put up with the way they live theirs.First of all because of privacy. Secondly because of what I think is a great community, and finally because I truly believe Linux is the future of personal computers.  

Once the entire Steam library is available to Linux, and making games compatible with Linux on release date is the new norm, gamers of tomorrow will have a very hard time coming up with excuses to stick with Windows or Mac. And I am 100% sure it will happen. Learning Linux today with put you several curves ahead of the rest.Makes sense to me. People are limited to the library of series and movies they've watched. So when they give a rating from 1-5 it is compared to the best and worst movie they've seen, and not to any universal standard people can relate to.The instability with Arch comes from the AUR and not the Kernel itself. They're limited to the same Kernel other bleeding edge distro's uses and are not unique in that sense. The freedom of choice and having everything at your disposal is the upraise and downfall for Arch.Getting tired of the "Messi" comparisons now. "Iranian Messi", "Swedish Messi", "American Messi", "Mexican Messi", enough.You wouldn't believe it without proof.OpenBSD will be the winner in this case, followed by a tie between Debian and CentOS, Arch comes in last not because it's less secure than Debian and CentOS, but because it's bleeding edge and is by design more unstable.Is this when you're trying to boot the USB? Or is this what happens after you finished installing? Looks like a gpu problem to me, Nvidia?  

When you get the black screen try pressing ctrl + alt + F1, log in with your username and password, then type sudo apt remove --purge nvidia* then type rebootCheck your PM :)I am interested in this myself. What you're probably looking for is a [RHCSA](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa) certificate, and continue to build upon that base with additional RHLE certificates. It should land you a few interviews. Regardless of the path you're interested in, be it system administrator, webdeveloper or programming it is going to take time and dedication. My advice is to figure out exactly which field you want to focus on and stick with it, because if you hop trains and have start all over it's going to take for ever.Would [this](http://askubuntu.com/questions/484434/install-ubuntu-without-cd-and-usb-how) help?Which brings me back to my question, what is the common practice? Do they get adopted by shelters and strangers, do they retire and live with their handlers or will they get euthanized? Just as interested about what happens to the military dogs that are even more aggressive btw.Which is what I was thinking about as well. I remember watching a show on tv where the police officer himself said it was not allowed to pet the dog because it wasn't safe. This specific dog was trained to chase down and immobilize criminals, and that's what its been trained to do its entire life. Of course there's other police dogs doing other jobs, but I would be very skeptical of letting a man-hunter in to my home unless my name was Cesar Millan :^)I don't know man, I've seen some pretty vicious police dogs that looks ready to kill anyone stepping a wrong foot. If you trust a fighting dog with your toddler then more power to you. Fighting people to be more precise. But I got your point, they're trained to obey. Do they euthanize ex-police dogs? Just curious since I don't see them as perfect family dogs once they've been trained to attack people.Well, as a beginner your eyes doesn't fool you, you can see the difference between them. On a technical level they're all Linux at their core. You can easily go for the one you find most appealing and it's just as much Linux as the rest of them.  

Ubuntu is a good beginner distribution because of all the Q&A you'll find on Google if there's something you need help with. Most of which is applicable to a lot of Linux distributions, however the "app store" or repositories which we call them, that comes with Ubuntu is well featured with a lot of useful software. If the distribution you choose doesn't ship with the software you want and don't have it in their repositories, you're gonna have to add new repositories yourself. A fairly simple task on its own, but if you don't know what you're doing you could end up adding untrusted sources that could harm your computer. That's my two cents on why Ubuntu is a good beginner distro. Lots of answers on Google and it ships with tons of trusted software.  

Some distributions focuses on being as compatible as possible with all the latest applications, while others go down a different road of only recommending proprietary-free software, like for instance installing Steam on every distribution isn't as simple as finding it in the app store or typing the install command from your terminal.  

[See this illustration](http://futurist.se/gldt/wp-content/uploads/variants/gldt1008-fancy.png) for a full map of the history of Linux. What you can take away from this is there are 3 major branches based off of Debian, Slackware and Red Hat, and a few other smaller branches. They're all Linux with small differences in the way they do things. You won't find a lot of people using the majority of distro's on this list on their personal computer, because a lot of them are designed to fulfill very specific needs or supply niche markets, others are just projects created by hobbyists and enthusiasts, and some just too hard for most people to use.  

Another thing you can take away from this map is that Elementary isn't on it. It is a fairly young distribution compared to the rest. It is still in its beta stage and depending on what the team behind it may decide, they could quickly do a whim on the design choices. Also, despite being based off Ubuntu, Elementary OS is not an officially supported release of Ubuntu. Which *could* mean you won't have access to all the packages and updates that are released by the official Ubuntu repositories. Somebody else can probably answer that since I've never tried Elementary. Wow that was beautiful, thank you. Here, have an imaginary gold ✪Exaggerated? They're not even hiding it.  

* [Service Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/servicesagreement/default.aspx)

* [Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)

They openly admit to monitor all your activity in Windows, and to cooperate with third parties who collects data of your activity outside it. Just putting the pieces together and creating a full map of your profile. You know, completely normal stuff. Not spying.  

They collect information of any personal data you have stored on your device, including your full name, phone number, address, emails, contacts, *all of it*. And not just an estimated number either. They store statistics down to the very specific number of how many images you have, documents, video files, audio files, how many of them you have opened, what programs you used to open them. I mean the list goes on but I would be a nutcase to write all of them down. The documents you agree to before installing Windows consists of more than 12,000 words. 

Whether you're surfing the web or playing a video game, they collect data on the exact time you did it, how long you were doing it, and how often. Some of the stuff that was written in the Service Agreement and Privacy Statement was even so absurd they decided to remove it due to all the negative attention it attracted.  

This is just the tip of the iceberg, and if you believe they're being completely upfront about everything they're monitoring as well then you're a prime candidate to join some religious cult, because that takes a lot of faith. /Pun intended.  

And despite how far beyond what information should be "Ok" for a cooperation to collect, some people try to shrug it away with poor excuses like you can turn most of these options off. Well you can't, really. Microsoft keeps sending thousands of packages about your computer even with all settings turned off to who knows, millions(?) of servers they own for statistical purposes. Servers they're even trying to hide under obscured reg.names. You would have to look up the server info and scroll through the information before Microsoft's name finally appears. You can download [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and monitor it live with your own eyes. [Here's a guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVzc5wK2-pc) who works in network security's take on it. It's just an extremely suspicious behavior from a company with way too much power. I don't even want to think about what kind of cooperation they might have with the government and law authorities.  

So to conclude, I don't know what part of Windows being a spyware you think is exaggerated, but if you ask me, it is downplayed. Linux on the other hand has no clue who you are, what you do or when you do it. It's not even comparable. They're two completely different beasts. If Windows is your fly on the wall, Linux is your blind bat.I think you should know that no popular and widely used operating system is 100% secure from hacking or CIA's long fingers. But the good news is while Microsoft is aware of many exploits perhaps left there intentionally by design, or just too integrated in their code to the point where they won't or can't fix it, I dunno - Linux rushes to fix these problems as soon as they're discovered. At least that's something to help you sleep better at night.  

You could dual boot if you wanted to, but chances are you would eventually end up booting in to your Windows partition and forget you have Linux altogether. Rebooting your system when you're done using Windows specific software to Linux isn't something that everybody bothers to follow through after a while. There's now [over 3000 titles](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/02/3000-steam-linux-games-available) for Linux on Steam, so you could also use Linux as your daily drive if the games you're playing are available. Phrases like "there's no good games for Linux" has become a myth.  

Unless you have no other option, I would recommend using óne computer for Windows specific games/applications, and óne Linux computer you can kick back with for everything else.  

For a beginner there isn't a whole lot of difference between distributions besides the preinstalled applications, desktop environments, file managers and package installers, a lot of which comes down to personal preference. When I first switched to Linux and tried different distributions, the deal breaker for me turned out to be the repositories which essentially works like an app store. All distro's come with their own repositories that is tailor made for the type of needs/work they are designed to fulfill.  

I found that Ubuntu had all the software a beginner could need in their official repositories, as well as being easy to use and find support if needed. I think that's why most people recommend it as a beginner distribution too, it doesn't require you to add additional repositories or mess with manual installments of applications.  

Ubuntu is more about convenience than security however. Most of the CIA exploits which was aimed at Linux was mainly against Ubuntu and Linux Mint due to their popularity. If the *only* thing you care about is privacy and security [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) looks very promising with only two major security breaches in 20 years? although it is closer to MacOS than Linux in its architecture. The only thing you'll have to make sure before installing is hardware compatibility. OpenBSD doesn't work with all Wifi's for instance, at all. 

 If you're really paranoid I recommend installing [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) onto a live dvd or a usb, but it is very inconvenient to use on a daily basis since it doesn't leave any footprint on your computer or store any identifiable information unless you specifically tell it otherwise by creating a persistent storage. It also ships with the Tor browser as the default browser, and is by design notoriously difficult to trace, or distinguish other Tails users from one-another. In other words, using Tails should feel like booting into a freshly installed operating system every time you use it, and therefor have no saved settings or bookmarks ect from previous sessions.  

Sorry for the lengthy post but I am very interested in the topic myself and spend a lot of time skimming the surface of it. I could simply say install Ubuntu or Fedora (less beginner friendly) if you haven't tried Linux before, but that wouldn't really count for much either. Have fun!I have everything to hide, my business is nobody's business but my own.It is true there are some distro's which focuses on convenience above safety. But at the same time there are hardened Linux distro's that are far more secure than their siblings. I will install OpenBSD on my laptop however and give it a good run. You're probably right. I'm not disagreeing or pretending I know a whole lot about BSD. I can only look to the past and compare both Mac and Linux to BSD where security threats was almost non existent due to how little traction they had in the consumer market. And as soon as they got more popular security holes suddenly increased. Even some ancient exploits that was overlooked for decades arose. If BSD is as secure as you say it is, I'll definitely give it another look.I am not looking to argue, but for argument sake despite being funded by DOD, I doubt they have more competent people working on security than oh let's just say Apple for the sheer size of their cooperation. Linux is also known for focusing on privacy and security with contributors from all over the world. And if this is a number game, OpenBSD and BSD derivatives alike might have some very competent people on their projects (I am still aware you're talking about OpenBSD specifically, so am I + in general), but that has never stopped engineers from overlooking exploits which usually requires another set of eyes to spot. And like I said, if this is a number game BSD systems isn't exactly overcrowded. I assume they've done just as many mistakes as engineers at other big open source projects or proprietary software companies have done, but have fewer people to single them out.And my point was their efforts are pointless since Tails leaves no infringing evidence behind."Security in obscurity" isn't security at all. Just because OpenBSD flies low on the radar for now doesn't mean it's any safer than the rest. In fact I beg to differ. Once law enforcements starts hacking away on BSD systems, I expect them to find far more bugs and exploits than they have in Linux or Mac. It's a calculated assumption based on the number of eyes that are checking the code for flaws, and fingers that are working on fixing them.Have you used Tails? Have you read the Tails documentation? The whole point about Tails is to leave no footprint and everyone using Tails looks like the same user. It doesn't store any information on your device, everything is temporarily pulled into RAM, so when you unplug your live USB there is nothing to find. They can search through all your belongings and they'll have nothing to show for it except all the time they've wasted.So when was the last time you tried it, 1999?Duuuude, you just made the best wallpaper I've ever seen! Thanks :DComon guys I think you're lacking a bit of imagination here. Their language is obviously more complex than ours combined. They probably didn't mean to say "this is not a warning, you have been warned" Google translate just fucked it up. I switched to Linux about 3 years ago abandoning my favorite game at the same time (League of Legends) because it ran horrible on my new Linux machine. It was the only game I enjoyed playing and I still miss it every day, but that's how much I despise Windows and their policies. Was it worth it? Most definitely. It's about voting with your actions and saying no to invasion of your privacy.  

But despite missing League I have to admit Linux enriched my gaming experience. There's now [over 3000 Linux games available on Steam](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/02/3000-steam-linux-games-available) and the number is growing by the week. I've played some brilliant games I would've never given a second glance if I still played League, mostly Indie games mind you, but with over 3000 titles to choose from excuses like "there's no good games for Linux" has turned into a myth.  

For your daily tasks like checking emails, browsing the web, watching movies, listening to music, downloading torrents and so forth there isn't a whole lot to take in to consideration. A user that only needs their computer for this would probably never noticed they switched OS.  

I personally love Debian based distros and I've tried all the official Ubuntu flavors plus a few that's not. I use Ubuntu on my desktop and Lubuntu on my laptop and haven't really found a good reason to switch to Arch, Slackware or Red Hat derivatives although I've tested them out. I'm just too accustomed to the APT package manager and the Ubuntu repositories which is just a fancy way of saying "app store" if you're not familiar with those terms. You'll be more than fine on Ubuntu so don't worry about getting lost in the jungle of different distros for now.  

A [cheat-sheet](http://www.cheat-sheets.org/saved-copy/ubuntucheatsheet.jpg) like this will come a long way for any beginner. One of the things you may wanna do right away if you haven't already is the commands under the "Package Management" sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade followed by sudo apt autoremove. Enjoy!Flash in 2017? Damn that's a lot of wasted time bruh.I think this is a phenomenon the press figured was good for business back in the days before the internet. Almost everyone read more than one newspaper and because it was such a big source of entertainment, people enjoyed evasive journalism a lot more since you could always read what was actually said in one of the other 3-4 newspapers you read daily. Now people have the internet for entertainment, we just want news to be factual news, it is literally the only reason we read them and the newspapers haven't quite caught on to that yet.Ah, the classic method of staying single for ever. On the bright side, too much eye contact might get you some pepper spray in the eyes. Trust me.If you watch a few more of his videos like the OP clearly has done it's hard not to see he has a mental disorder. My guess is autism, so it's not cringy. It's just sad seeing somebody try to take advantage of him to gain some internet karma. You do realize he has some sort of mental disorder, why don't you find a video of people with downs syndrome and make a cringe post about them? For reference [Biggest Youtube Glitch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk3Cp22WQPw) Not only was it a coincidence, but PewDiePie's channel was also targeted intentionally. The same person could sub & unsub repeatedly and cause the channel to lose -2 sub every time they did so. Thousands of people were simultaneously attacking PewDiePie's and a few other's channels over the course of  two days. I was there to witness the glory unfold. #IwasthereThe downside of using a trackball. In my experience this happens either because of what megatog615 said, or because the ball and the ball-bearings are *too* clean, causing them to create friction due to the lack of any oil/grease. You just can't win.You can see she was getting the ball for her grandson, just look at the little kid's disappointment when he realizes that jerk is gonna steal the ball.The answer is very simple, *because it's fun*. But whenever this debate comes up it's hard not to mention the elephant in the room. I'm just gonna assume you're on Windows since Mac isn't that much different from Linux.  

First of all there are very few malwares aimed at Linux. It's probably safe to assume we're talking about a range of a few hundred if even that, while there are literally millions aimed for Windows. You should Google how effective anti-virus programs are while you're at it, because most competent IT people will tell you it's a false security, a spyware itself, could possibly harm your computer and will most definitely slow it down.  

Secondly you have those annoying forced updates on Windows that always happen in the most inconvenient times although you specifically set it to only update at 4 o'clock in the morning. On Linux you decide exactly when (and if you wanted) what you want to update.  

Thirdly, if you ever need to install something on Windows you're gonna have to open your browser, Google the accurate term, click through a number of links to find the correct one, and just blindly trust the provider hasn't put any malicious code in their .exe files. On Linux you pretty much have an appstore like you're probably familiar with through smartphones. All the apps in the official repositories are tested and approved by millions of people, as well as thoroughly checked by developers. The beauty of open source code.  

Finally, Windows is spyware. It collects information about every thing you do on your computer. Every file you have stored, every image you have opened, every video you have watched (down to the number, not ~ roughly), all the software you have installed and how often you use it, the list just goes on. There are some built in functions to turn off some of the tracking, but despite doing so you can monitor traffic from Windows to thousands of Microsoft owned websites for statistical purposes by using technologies like WireShark. It is an invasion of your privacy compared to letting your government install cameras on every corner of your house, and say it's ok because the cameras look pretty. Linux simply doesn't do that.  

I could also mention all the different desktop environments you can choose from that all completely changes the way you interact with your computer, or the power of using the terminal to do practically anything you need, but that's a chapter you're better off seeing for yourself than me talking about it.  

I'm just gonna end where I started and say the main reason to use it is because it's fun.Is it possible for humans to revert back to living in the sea, or have we evolved past the point of no return? And if we could make such a evolutionary backtrack, where would we most likely evolve gills, on our neck? Our chest?Why did Tottenham sell him?Did you join the 'Yes man' program?
