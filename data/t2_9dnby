how do you bypass the cancel button! I can't install!my god, show the damn inside!assuming they haven't made provisions elsewhere, after all what were people supposed to do if a car parked there?I have one for my radio that did the same thing. Nothing a little masking tape couldn't fix. https://plus.google.com/114451694119653747033/posts/CZgjCJ7zhkG

spanish(?) versionthere *is* something there!kardashian? what makes it come back down again? wouldn't it be travelling at the same speed than the wave going up, so there's always a gap between them? only **3** four leaf clovers?redditor for 5 years and this is the first time you've come across this? wow.not really, it's usually all over social media, music and tv/movies. much more accessible. woah woah woah! Tea bag, boiling water then immediately milk? Still doing it wrong. Let it brew first, remove bag *then* milk!you normies waiting to be spoon fed dank clips. rrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeepop the boot, climb through, gone. guy is clearly a schmo. you shouldn't pass an elephant at speed as they can be easily spooked. Drivers speed too, but don't mention it! ;)d'oh, thanks!could try ~~/r/whatisthisplant~~ if you have not got an answer yet. I often wonder whether Boris is genuinely dopey or it's all a ruse so he can get away with doing stupid shit under the guise of a lovable but dim-witted rogue. 

I think he deserves more criticism than he gets tbh.I think the only golfer I *might* recognise would be Tiger Woods, but I'm not even 100% sure of that. Not everyone is into the same things. my main character is a Dwarven Defender and still gets wrecked after the first two. I rolled him after playing a sorcerer in BG1 and dying so many times in the tutorial at Candlekeep!
it's great fun, but fuck me it's hard. I'm playing it again after years away and some parts are just so hard without knowing what's coming and preparing appropriately. 

I'm at a part in Nalias castle fighting 6 Golems and i've been trying so long! It's really fucked up how difficult it is, but also quite refreshing after years of auto-regenerating health and being spoon fed a story. 

If you don't want to play (or don't have it) I highly recommend [colonelRPG](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjonWpLT8cK4CqJW7qfCZ8A) on youtube, watching his play throughs got me back into the "real" rpgs. lets you feel better.you silly billy, the smoke replaces coal dust and makes you healthier. who's cutting all the edges?That's actually a miniature giant space cat. no, it's non-white people pretending to be white, Ã  la bpt. If your tastes don't align with "most of Europe" why would you think it should rank so highly?Is it still a world record if there are no official adjudicators? stink bomb their doorway and when they ask you to stop remind them of this. makes me wonder why I don't just throw up the same or better spec at a lower price myself. I suppose 3 years warranty is nice(ish) though. 

wait, I'm far too lazy to do that. I can tell right away it needs more RGB. She musn't visit /r/pcmasterracestopwe've all been there.and what about all the people that agree with him? Don't worry, the closer to the car they get the safer. > I love how many people come running out to ~~help~~ see the aftermath. 
OK god-dammit! Stop criticizing my choice of language! This is a FREE COUNTRY! THE EU can no longer dictate what words I use and in what order I use them.

http://www.jeep-community.de/showthread.php?t=27560Don't take it personally, I'm just bored and on Reddit. 
Didn't wear ATGATT. /r/motorcyclesI'm shitposting on Reddit, it's really not an issue for me. Thank you sir for clarifying, I have tagged you appropriately for future use. don't they have emergency stop buttons? Seems like every escalator in the UK does at the top and bottom. no idea. 

If I had to guess is was because I don't know his/her/zer gender, seems more appropriate for addressing a single person, I didn't consider the ramifications, I neglected to ask you before posting.Yeah, because the Zombie theme hasn't 'done to death' *yet*. If you carry it for work isn't it just a work tool? I use a variety of tools every day for work but they aren't "EDC". A pen that stays at home (obviously not a carry). Single key on a keyring, single car key on another ring, Why bother?. It's a bit of a stretch just to include anything brass imo. 

It's basically tiny knife, wallet, pen and zippo.because ~~(s)~~he told all his ~~their~~ Reddit friends in an alternative manner. even if they banned the built in encryption people will just use software to encrypt over the unsecure network (ala openPGP/gpg4win when shopping on the likes of Silkroad). The only people it would effect are the ones who don't know about it. Any terrorist with half a brain would be fine. nice cosplay dude. $50k for a T72? Bargain! Bet the delivery charge is a bitch though!precycling? Nice. too much sun today, people would be blinded![Enhance](http://imgur.com/a/pQCAl). Deutchland/Germany. Good call, guess there's more to war than monetary value! :)yeah, they probably knew better. I'm just mulling it over. Nah, gotta get that first tweet/facebook status. Even empty I thought a tank would have been a higher value target. They can't be easy to come by and removing that asset would be a boon. seems like hitting the tank would have been "worth" more, no?The Brexit vote was 48% remain, there are a fair few of us. 

it's not nascar. rivington?WTF is up with that Phillips screw though? No M3.5s?Which character? I'm replaying now and recently started act 7. But if they didn't announce it how would we even know? Then we'd have more calling for trans people in gaming. 

OK, we need helicopter rally. /r/Tenagra Hmmm?I'd eat it, sure. But it's not the best looking breakfast I've ever seen. 

Those tomatoes just look so sorry for themselves. I can just imagine the guy preparing the food thinking it's all posh with 3 roasted, on-the-vine cherry tomatoes. Reminds me of my own cooking which I take exceptional pride in but is most likely mediocre. all those stats in the corner yet nothing for intoxication. literally unplayable. it's literally all over reddit, no one is going to ask. a comment, as requested. You could try with a regular bit, but be careful. Otherwise a ceramic drill bit/tile cutter(who knew!).Sounds like you're the pretentious arsehole. No wonder you can't find a place without them. Is that a CRT TV too?enter the workforce and get it discount through the employee schemes. I really like Hamilton's writing, but mainly because the books are rather long. Night's Dawn Trilogy is one of my favourites. How does that stack up against paying for the electricity to run your PC?

[NPower suggests](https://blog.npower.com/2013/02/ever-wondered-how-much-your-appliances-cost-to-run/) that an average PC costs 6 or 7 pence per hour to run (I would guess gaming PCs are above average consumption if high spec). How often do you get cards and what are they worth?
They're basically a hook to get you further committed to Steam. Must collect cards, gather trophies, buy games just to get awards, etc. 

Did I mention I'm very cynical?I make a pretty good brew. It's best they try nothing, usually my dad makes things worse! 

On the plus side though I bought him a NAS device to save his important stuff, and now he just formats when things go pear shaped on the PC! reg/rec converts alternating current to direct current, you still need an alternator or dynamo to generate the electricity.Couple of hookers. I guess they're practically mercenaries now?He should see a priest about it. Do you really think he never had a TV and bought the xbox, games and 3 pads? *Really*? Think about it. Have Steam Link to my TV with a bicycle on a turbo trainer in my living room. Really need a recumbent to game for any length of time, but oh well. Baseball caps a re widely acceptable, but I wouldn't call them gentlemanly. They're just a casual hat. Depends on the occasion I would guess. Top Hat for the Grand National, bowler for a day out in London (must be paired with a block brolly). Flat cap with tweed for country walks, not sure if that's "gentlemanly" though. ybal'Mpeople already tell bullshit stories IRL. Syfy's the Expanse is the greatest sci-fi ever made. who has a personal account and refers to themselves as "we" (Other than The Queen)?That's an odd one, usually insurance companies are OK with like-for-like replacements. Understanding that not every part lasts forever. I mean, it is and it isn't. If you're just polishing a turd such as a Vauxhaul Nova (or a Corsa for our younger readers) you're pretty much perceived as a 'boy racer'. Same goes for "mods" on decent cars like big bore exhausts (look at me!), bonnet scoops, ironing board spoilers, tacky body-kits and cheap Halfords alloys spaced so wide you can hear the bearings screaming. So lucky! After watching his other vids it's amazing he's still alive. Title clearly says Kung Fu, you wrote Karate! Bamboozled!Looks more like guy kicks scooter rider off his bike and steals his phone!I get not subscribing to cable/satellite TV, but don't you guys have free to air/watch channels? Even the BBC has adverts of a sort. > HFC

Depends where you buy it.
