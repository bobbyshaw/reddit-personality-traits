Finally! Have you used cryptomator to encrypt your cloud storage? Thanks for taking the time writing the paper. It is a reference manual for me to which I refer back often It has been a few months. Any update yet? This would definitely be nice >You should find the technology interesting despite the people

You should focus on what is great about "your" project, not what is wrong with the others https://gist.github.com/superjamie/ac55b6d2c080582a3e64As someone unfamiliar with Linux and the command line, Mint has been great to learn with. As I get more comfortable I will try something else but for now mint is enough of a challenge Thanks for sharing about Owncloud ! Another use for my pi> Riccardo is entitled to his own opinions, but in the status quo, all his comments on Reddit and trolling on Twitter represent this entire organization to others whether that's something you believe in or not.

You are correct and his trolling has kept me from investing in what I think has great potential as an investment and a currency.I went several years ago and was fortunate enough to visit very early in the morning before the hoardes of tourists arrived. The acoustics in the ball court are absolutely amazing. Our guide had us imagine what it would be like when a game was going on.^^^ install a new rom with nano gapps ^^^If you have traveled out of the country lately you have updated photos taken when reentering through immigration. Also all of the new state ID's and drivers license are getting your facial recognition. It's like a lost cause. It's difficult to divide into smaller amounts and is difficult to travel with and easy to steal and sell. Alt coins are the future..Dash, Bitcoin, Monero etc. Easily divisible, to transfer and nothing to carry except 12 words memorized. Difficult to steal as well contrary to the media madness surrounding bitcoin theftsNot making excuses for his company but it is wise to not leave extra lying around in a company for exactly that reason. A lawsuit can take it all. Don't worry about him, he still has his riches. 

Very good information in his books even if they were not based upon real life experiences. It set me off on a path of passive income which I wouldn't have gone if not for his Rich dad bookI too am new to VPN but this may help you decide https://gist.github.com/kennwhite/1f3bc4d889b02b35d8aa  How about the strawman arguement that pot users like so much (it's not as bad as alcohol). It's better than the narcotics that I would be using to control my pain
I am more excited about closing my Kraken account than the huge volume increase that will happen from Polo. **I hate Kraken**That will  create spam. Think about the masternodes who have to go through each proposal each monthNice ! It just needs one more circle added...I can't handle the pain anymoreThere are some pretty popular ones on there. Thanks for sharing#1 LOL> some VPNs have massive security failures like using the same encryption key for all users

How do you find out about this ?
Can you give any examples ?

I am relatively new to using VPN's and would like to get one of the more secure ones when I get my network more streamlinedICN is pure speculation right now. After the platform is established we will have to do year by year comparisons. ICN value comes merely from deflation but at a starting point of 100 million 

ICNX will be valued on performance and speculation. ICNX tokens will be purchased using ETH and traded independently. Wow. I never heard of someone against dishwashers. Do you wash your own clothes in a bucket??  

I wash my dishes by hand and then throw them in the dishwasher to take advantage of the high heat dry to make sure they are **really clean**. 

It typically uses more water to wash by hand than a dishwasher. Dishwashers can clean the dishes using 5 gallons of water, try that in the sink. It would be difficult even with a dual bowl sink filled on each side.

All of my water goes right back down in my backyard, percolates through ground and comes right back up into my house. If you are worried about water usage and energy try moving out of the city on well and septic. Much less water and energy used. I hate city water and all of its chemicals to treat the water and treat the pipes to prevent corrosion

^^ ICNX has the potential for much larger returns and is diversified. It is a planned index fund of hand picked alt's. ICN is going to grow only from the buyback (burn) with the profits from the platformUsing kodi for all of my tv viewing has eliminated ads from my tv. Pi-hole and browser extensions has removed most ads from my browsing and sales fliers go straight into the recycling bin. I am not part of this materialistic society.

>Avoid megastores and big corporations.

I adhere to this for dining out. Rarely do I visit a chain restaurant.  It seems like they are your only option but there are many mom and pop owned restaurants that have made from scratch food that is healthier and cheaper. All while benefiting an entrepreneur and his familyThey can identify however they want. I just call them queersI bet it is close. Guys have Earrings, skinny jeans and little pony tails atop their heads. Bunch of panzies... I just shake my headMany people don't realize what truckers do to make a buck. My brother used gallon jugs and Gatorade bottles It's not fun. Sure recipe for a bad trip Ex Illinois resident and I concur. Get out while you still can. Property taxes killed me. My only regret is not leaving sooner. Illinois is a death spiral state. StartPage itWe all know mother Jones is just another liberal propaganda site. Not a credible source. Surprised they didn't know that Luckily Obama has funded a propaganda campaign to combat narratives it does not like. http://bit.ly/2i3rRxURaspberry pi 3 can work in conjunction with your own router Like we wouldn't have roads without the government. Mind trapped people How is this determined? True index funds just go off market cap. Yes we all know how important college is. http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=8986   Unschooling is actually gaining quite a bit of attention lately and makes a lot of sense. I wish that I had learned about it sooner. This is a result of the liberalized government run education system in the United States Kind of funny considering that half of the "kodi media players" are Amazon firesticks. They have sold a shit ton more than they would have if it weren't for the ability to sideload kodi To be quite honest it is impossible to learn everything. One must always make decisions on what to learn based upon practical use, personal enjoyment or necessity. Why does the government determine what must be learned? Half of the country can't manage their own personal finances but spend hundreds of hours gaining useless knowledge during their 12 years of primary education. 
How about home repair, gardening, survival skills? We have a bunch of book smart panzies coming out of the schools these days AA can't even make up his mind about blocksize. He should pay dash royalties to speak about it. Notice that he is jumping on the ETH bandwagon so he doesn't run out of topics. Btc is stuck in the block size and fee loop and may never recover How about working to help support the family? How far removed are you from farming families? My dad went to school part time through 8th grade and never went to high school. He ended up maxing out his social security contributions most of his working life. Don't place too much emphasis on attending high school. With today's lower standards it means even less than 30 years ago Neither one of my parents stepped foot inside of a high school until their children attended. They are both much smarter than the average high school graduate. Many important things in life are learned through experience and common sense. No they couldn't help me with trig homework or physics but you know what...I never needed it after high school either. They don't need to be in your area for wallofcoins. Any fifth 3rd bank or Wells Fargo can take the deposit. I don't live near a major city and I had more than a handful to choose from Polo or wallofcoins I will have to check that. Mine is painfully slow. So slow I thought of using chromiumAmen brother. There is so much false information out there promoting marijuana use. It's not all roses. I was addicted to weed for 2 decades. Stole all my motivation to do anything. Risked failing a drug test at a very good job and losing that job because of my addiction. Smoked all day everyday and even at work. 

Haven't smoked in close to 10 years and have clarity of mind and motivation. Time to buy a few more. It's a good day to pick up alts on the cheap Go on Amazon and buy an unlocked phone that works for multiple carriers. Then throw a rom on it. I can't understand why people buy their phones from a carrier in the first place I ended up joining the lights mid run and capped the ends of the 14/2 in the switch box. It was tricky fishing the wire but I was able to accomplish this without cutting holes in the drywall which was wonderful. Public garbage services cost twice as much as private. Public Schools are running deficits each year and private schools cost less per student and provide better education. Privately owned toll roads make a profit vs publicly owned toll roads. 

Public transportation is publicly subsidized transportation for people who don't own cars. Why should I as a tax payer who doesn't use public transportation pay for those who use it. I am fully in support of user fees. Charge enough so that the budget is balanced. 

Roller rings, skating rinks, water parks should not publicly funded. If there is a need and demand then an individual or group of investors will open one. Too many examples as such that are nothing more than tax payer money pitsI understand the reasoning  but we are looking at them burning 100k tokens out of 100 million. That is a drop in the bucket.

 The article linked does point out some positive impacts regarding taxes and opening up new markets as a result of burning vs dividends. 

We will see if there is any impact on the price during the next year. 
So that people can leave the ghetto inner cities fasterIt will lose money. Like all other things run by the government. Neither efficiency nor profit are known to themI just googled iconomi white paper earlier today and downloaded it straight from search results. (StartPage, F Google) 

It's the first result, the one from brave new coin? PIA has lots of locations available. If you connect close to home it's fast ( I don't notice a speed decrease), if I connect on the other side of the world it is dramatically reduced. Several states away just drops the speed a few mbs

The raspberry maxes out around 50mbs I think. Can't remember off the top of my head. They are terrible. Try wallofcoins dot comI always use addresses from guerillamail. No loss thereCheck out Wall of Coins. Punch in location and there are lots of local banks where you can deposit cash and have btc sent to you. Woc holds btc in escrow, it's p2p selling. You can use a Google number if you choose to stay anonymous or regular cell if you are not worried about kyc

It's cheaper than local btcFor now. First mover status doesn't last forever. Look at Ford Can't Google still see your traffic? That's awesome. I will give it a try You're absolutely correct. Why wait hours and pay large fees when I can use another coin to transmit the same value for less than 1 cent and have it there in minutes. No more than 10 which would be the fastest and most costliest in BtcTry it. You send a transaction with a 25 cent fee and tell me how long it took. I am speaking from practical experience. http://moneyandstate.com/the-true-cost-of-bitcoin-transactions/
Then try it with another alt like eth or dash. Speed and cost will kill btcMy point was, you don't have a clue. Fees haven't been that low in years. But who needs bigger blocks? I like how the link to the 25 cent price is from 3 years ago. If you tried that now your transaction would take at least 24 hours for a confirmation He realizes btc is jacked, that's why he is jumping on the ETH bandwagon now. Even writing a book about it. Diversification of his speaking talents so he isn't Left Behind Nothing but a false narrative. The CIA was just exposed as having the ability to hack the phones prior to being encrypted with the app. 

Keeping up the narrative to convince the sheep that encryption = bad. Just like bitcoin = drug dealersHow much is a complete kit? I couldn't find prices on the siteThis will make local bitcoins even more attractive. It's less about AML and more about tracking **everyones** profit for taxes.

I just read a post last week about coinbase needing to verify identity with a webcamPia gives you up to 5 connections, you can install on a raspberry pi and have your lan go through that and your router.

Then install pi-hole as well to block ads on your network Exactly...misinformation. That's how the government works. Newspeak from the George Orwell playbook, 1984Wth, I just glanced at it.

https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacyI would give you gold for the link if I had it. That was super easy and quick. 3 calls in under 5 minutes, 1 was a human too !Just to be safe I packed some in each of my checked bags. They didn't bother with what I had in my carry on. It was all just in zip locks with the color written on it in magic marker.

On my return home (this was an international flight) I was called over the PA while waiting to board for a secondary search. I almost shit my pants. I had to bring my carry on and be searched again. I had my drone and half a dozen bags of kratom. The security was more interested in my drone and didn't even pull the bags of kratom out. I was half joking before I left that I should stuff the kratom into the battery compartment of the drone. That would have made things interesting Did you follow a guide or have some link to setup your phone without Google Play Services ?

But that didn't stop all hospitals and insurance companies for using it for that exact purpose for years. Now that most databases have been hacked that info is everywhere.Destroy the family unit. Let Big Brother watch over you and train you from cradle to grave.

 Churches and people took care of orphans and widows. Now it's all about income redistribution and government safety netsYou can tell it's a woman from the shoes SmhUpvoted for the comment and your flairI  meant income tax and appreciation tax liabilities from the masternode. The strong arm of the government will mandate that you pay all the other taxes
So that somewhat confirms my theory that people only pay what they are *legally* obligated to payIt is supposed to be later this year. I would imagine that with the increased budget due to the appreciation of the value of Dash it would speed up the timelineu/moocowmoo has it set up so it pays automatically every 7.x days. It's like clockwork. The deposit goes in and I get an email. From my 75 shares I deposited on Dec 1 I have earned over 1 dash. It is averages . 12 dash every payout. The communication is great. He digitally signs each communication and you get a recorded receipt for your deposit. 

Yes he could run off with it. He is also an active contributor to the dash community. 

When evolution comes out it is supposed to be be possible to do this "trustless" From what I know about it the btc should be in escrow. It shouldn't take this long but you will get them Start trying to do that and you will open yourself up to tax liabilities as well Do you still have bugs? I have version 1.2 and can't send dash. Cleared the cache and other currencies load but not dash. I reinstalled and dash gets hung up on initializing wallet
