EDIT: Memory did not serve.As an American, I'm not surprised. The average American doesn't know who Erdogan *is*, let alone know *what he's doing*. For the car seat case: 2018 or 2019 the US is mandating side-impact protection. Most car seats have this already (especially the Euro-focused models), but some of the cheapest ones don't have this. They're safe, just not as safe. Further, the one we got was  ridiculously easy to install and remove, and had great compatibility with strollers. Again, some of the cheaper ones did not. 

In the end, we paid more (2.5x more but including stroller 'system') than super cheap options, with the added peace of mind of meeting future requirements and significantly easier install/removal than others.Didn't they just release this only a few weeks back? I've been working my way through the [eve lore guide](https://evetravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mark726s-eve-lore-survival-guide-v-2-5-1-pics1.pdf), and look forward to exploring the portal in greater detail soon. 

I completely agree with the changes you and /u/estedestirr are suggesting.[File a bug](https://community.eveonline.com/support/submit-bug-report), it'll get fixed.Sure, it's hot initially, but CO issues are usually from a malfunctioning  furnace, located not near bedrooms. Because of this physical distance (often including walls, ceilings, and floors), there's a lot of time for mixing with the rest of the air. Correct placement is knee level near/in bedrooms ([example source](http://www.lincolncounty.org/DocumentCenter/View/7767), there are plenty more for this).

Fires, of course, are hot, so their outputs are going to rise as you note and they're quick to strike and need to be dealt with *as soon as possible*. CO generators are chronic, and, by  the time they get to you are cold. Right, there are mandatory minimum levels of performance. Just bought a baby car seat and paid a lot more than than the minimum to get well above those mandatory minimums and better ease of use, but the cheap car seat would have been nearly as safe. Same deal with smoke detectors. Odds are the wifi connected smoke detector​is using the *exact same mechanism* of detection. 

As a side note: don't bother with the smoke/CO combos: CO starts  at the floor, while smoke starts at the ceiling. A single device is a big compromise.Shield *and* hull tanking is the norm if you want to have some semblance of a tank.

I know Brits aren't known for their amazing culinary prowess, but when that's the recommendation on the package, it's not going to get any better. Boiled or steamed  brussel sprouts are just a recipe for green, flavorless mush.

A much better way: heat up a cast iron pan. Trim and cut the sprouts in half or quarters lengthwise (so they don't fall apart). Ad butter or oil to the pan at medium to high heat, and toss in the sprouts. Salt and pepper, wait for caramelization, and occasionally turn the sprouts. 

Super easy, and very tasty. Holy stacking penalties Batman!Generally if you have to ask that question, you probably should.

Look at what killed it.While they don't have a portal that's as easy to access as the FCC one (or it's likely in Hebrew):

http://www.consumers.org.il/category/en-consumers

http://www.moc.gov.il/130-en/moc.aspx

The Ministry of Communications is probably the right place. They appear to be the regulator for this sort of thing.They've been milking the lines for *years*. DSL is run over POTS lines, which has very low RF bandwidth, high attenuation (doesn't go far), and it's bundled so there's a huge amount of challenges with crosstalk. It's an outdated technology simply because it's running over infrastructure that's crumbling in most parts of the world. 

Cable *does* have issues being a somewhat shared medium, but the amount of bandwidth it has is incredible (approaching 3Ghz), and very little attenuation relative to POTS lines. I'm a network guy, and if i had a choice between mediocre cable and DSL where I can physically see the CO, I'm going cable every time. Little b = bit  
Big B = Byte

Those are Megabit per second.OP didn't have a location at the time that I wrote my post.>What you need to do is find a better cable providing company

Assuming OP's in the US: Not likely to be available. There are exceedingly few places with multiple cable network providers (Boston is the only one that comes to mind). Monopoly, bitches!

> switch to a company that provides DSL

DSL is a horrible technology (cable internet is a clever kludge, but a kludge nonetheless), exacerbated by the fact most POTS providers are letting their cables rot on the line. It's slow, and not viable as a broadband service unless you live within a KM or so of the central office. They'll advertise "30mbps!", but you'll be lucky to get 10mbps if you're a mile or two away.~~First, file a complaint:
https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us~~ OP's original post didn't have a location, so I assumed US given the context. 

You'll get a call back very quickly from this. Your network provider is massively overprovisioned, and they know it. Overprovisioning (you have 1Gbps of bandwidth available, but you sell 5Gbps to customers) is a normal thing to do, as, typically, not everyone will be using their full allotment at once. But when you are, say, 10:1 overprovisioned, you'll hit issues. Odds are they're a lot more overprovisioned in your area than is commonly acceptable. Get your neighbors to file FCC complaints as well. They'll more-or-less be forced to update their headend.

Remember 40 Megabit (Mb) is 5 Megabyte (MB) per second. Network speeds are measured in Mb/sec, while OSes report in MB/sec speed primarily for historical reasons (if you're interested, I can write it up).  No, it does not. It's about whether or not you are labeled a criminal, e.g., with a misdemeanor or felony. A fine doesn't labeled someone a criminal (like a traffic ticket). A misdemeanor does.  

It's a subtle but very important difference. It  necessary to lower penalties, but not sufficient to be decriminalized.

If you look at the rest of my thread, you'll see that it *is* decriminalized as there is only a fine without an associated misdemeanor.[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gila_monster) is what it's named after.

Neither is Anathema, Cerberus, Macharial, Dramiel, any Minmatar capital, just to name a few, yet there *is* a correct pronunciation for all of them based on the particular language.

What do your contract say about delivery of the vehicle? If they haven't met that, then they are in breach. So far your damages are  any financing costs and any insurance costs, plus the $1500 that they owe you.

Find that out, they get on the phone with the general manager of the dealership and demand the car. If they're a corporate outfit, then call corporate and explain the situation. They won't want to leave a sour taste that will lead to bad publicity (even if it's only from you). Was he (I'm assuming he) a troll?

Thay will definitively answer my concern. The link doesn't actually have that level of detail.This is a misdemeanor then? Georgia has a [stop and identify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_and_identify_statutes#Obligation_to_identify) law, so it will be tied to your name, and, if it's a misdemeanor, you'll have a pretty obvious criminal record. Sure, not a felony, sure, it's a good move, but calling it decriminalizing isn't quite right.What caused it? Is the disc brake rubbing the cause or effect of the failure?> Some people are just ~~petty~~ assholes.

How many people pronounce Gila with a hard-g rather than HEE-la (the actual pronunciation)? - Memory max is very low
- Battery cannot be replaced easily
- Cannot replace/upgrade the SSD
- MFing F-keys
- Connectivity
- Hardware isn't much different from the 2015 models

The first two are present in the 2015 model (I have one of these for work, great little machine). I don't like it, but I'll deal. The next one is a serious issue. The Retinas you could replace it separate from everything else from third party vendors, but at outrageous prices. 

The last three though...  I'm one of the weirdos that has them set to F-keys, and not the overlay functions. The connectivity issues are well discussed (you get an adapter, and you get and adapter, everyone gets adapters!). Finally, the hardware bump between 2015 and late 2016 was... middling. The graphics chip isn't much better. The processor isn't much better. Can't go any bigger on memory. SSDs "upgrade" is outrageously expensive. 

At least with the 2015 model, they could pull the SSD and put it into a new chassis with the same (small number of) processor and memory configuration. Now, they either have to stock a crap load more options, or there's more downtime while they ship the same model around.

Ripples of a fracture perhaps?>This has diminished as a factor slightly with the reduction in massive bubble walls,
