Try printing it with 180C nozzle temp, it looks like there's a little too much heat on the layersNice, that black color finish looks greatThis is awfulI certainly wouldn't mind, I think we're lucky to live in an age where so much of our communication is over text. I think in person communication is very important, but I'd assume it would come together if wanted to continue.

I'd suggest a date where we can get by without talking. Go karts or something, maybeA true method actorI think they said Model T because there *were* some automobiles when she was born, just not affordable mass produced onesWe'll usually either split evenly or just rotate who picks up a tab. I tend to prefer the latter because I know some of my friends don't have as much disposable income (kids, etc), so I can make sure I grab the bigger tabs and they can handle the ones where we only have a few beers.That's true, I didn't mean to minimize itA bomb went off near the BVB team bus, and one of the players was injured (not like one of their stars or anything, but a teammate nonetheless). The details still aren't totally clear.

The game was still played the next day, and BVB lost. Secretly Jamarcus had burned his mixtape on it to see if Al Davis liked itOh! I found the way to disable it on Google product forums: https://support.google.com/chrome/forum/AAAAP1KN0B0sC65UE22_4w/?hl=enWe get it, you have the vaporsI actually really love Firefox on AndroidThat's actually a feature of Chrome on Android, and a quick Google around doesn't seem to tell me how to disable it :/And I think the fact that it can't exist alone makes it in fact a subpar representation of the strength of women — it is for all intents and purposes existing only through that which it is defyingAlthough in this case, the original is in fact still owned by the artist, he could remove the bull if he feels it doesn't represent his vision anymoreIf you send it to the subreddit (/r/reddit.com), it's passed along to the admin team.Dude don't question it you got free powerThat's a local IP, so no worries.

And WAN IPs really aren't really sensitive information, fwiw. They're kinda like license plates, albeit temporary ones — there isn't all that much you can do if you know one, and you're constantly showing yours to every website you drive byGlad you liked it! That was a feature of a small test we were running. Keep an eye out for new features inspired by it in the near future :)Could [send a message to /r/reddit.com using this link](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com) and the admin team will let you know what options you haveEek. I really hope the league starts to take head injuries more seriously. They've certainly gotten better, but there's still enormous pressure on players to play through concussion symptoms The Future is B Wright Phillips>not sure what their deal is.

We're the ones that actually know youAKA social security numbersSnapchat is actually one of the main media for communication with the 13-18 crowd right nowYea a user should always be allowed to delete their previous posts or edit out potentially personal info.Hahaha this had me panicked yesterday that I somehow had posted my work expense receipts to FacebookI really do find that I only end up eating deep dish when people are visiting.

I dunno crack is also a worse decision IMOI actually think they are really different uses. Google Maps location is for sharing my location with people I'm trying to meet up with. I share my location with my wife all the time, and then share ad-hoc if I'm trying to get friends to meet at a bar or whatever.

Trusted Contacts is for emergencies. My dad and I don't need to know where each other is all the time, but the ability to request it in an emergency is very helpful. And that's the key difference — Trusted Contacts is for *pulling* location, Maps is for *pushing*I don't if I was just in a great mood because of the warm wether finally, but this was the best episode yet IMO. It feels like you've really lasered in on the tone of the podcast and the chemistry between yallhahahaha "calamari"that looks like the crappiest first-class I've ever seen, what regional bus system is that?The original "ton" is 2,000 pounds. The metric "tonne" is 1,000 kg (about 100 kilos heavier than the imperial ton)The 650 is hand down the best remote made, if the lack of RF isn't an issue. Shame they killed itNice. I think it would look really cool with acrylic colored for the various lines . . . although that adds so much more work to itHey there! I actually think this post might generate better discussion on r/TheoryOfReddit. It's not a bug, really, so this probably isn't the best subreddit for itAndroid or iOS? What app version and OS version are you on?I actually am thinking she's right about all the issues described . . . except the final piece where it led to the specific Rule 30. That was originally a commentary on the fact that the "women" in cyber rooms were just guys pretending.

Obviously it's long since evolved from that, but it's the originbtw, that bubble is the quick scroll button. You can actually just drag and drop it out of the way to wherever you feel comfortable with itOf course it isn't . . .As many complaints as people in the thread have had about the ref today, it's nice to see a ref actually continue past the +4 minutes to account for the injury timeYea that looked bad too. I hope it's not serious :/A tale as old as timelolololol did Shep just say Ian Harkes is "better looking than John"?Thanks for the report, and double thanks for including the pages you were redirected to. I passed it along to our ads team to dig deeper and make sure we aren't serving malicious ads like that to users.Sacha could have sprung BWP sooner on that oneWas security supposed to stop Howard or . . . This is a bit of weird statement if I'm reading it right . . . "the fans didn't apologize/admit to it so Tim shouldn't have been punished as harshly"?Has he been good for DC? I always liked him at Seattle If you win two golden boots, do they give you a left and a right one so you can actually wear them? Because they should.BWP can't miss. What a finisherWhat's your read on the yellow for Lawrence's handling?https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Alex#PronunciationWHAT?! That's the worst yellow of the seasonHeh, Felipe is on the other side of a dive for onceIf you are downloading the original file, it's not getting recompressed. It's only screenshots and file format chagnes and the like that would do thatI wonder if SWP would get some playing time as a sub for Royer/Muyl if he were still on the teamYup. The play all flowed through Dax, and we let him walk and changed the formation instead. I'm afraid this is going to be a long yearWhy did the ref stop play there? Worried about the head injury?Unfortunately we've been celebrating Easter for three seasons apparentlyJeez, royer looks so uncomfortable with the ball. No confidence at all. I hope he's able to find his game soonFelipe might have gotten the call if he didn't have such a reputation for going to ground for anything more than a stiff breezeLot of contact there in the boxIs this gonna be another game full of corners for NY with no production? For as good as our set pieces are, we never seem to find the net on cornersThanks for the feedback, that certainly sound like the new tech stack test. Don't worry, it's far from a final product :)This wasn't a competitive match fyiYup, you could just keep going. A lot of filament types are more than happy to adhere to a fully cold previous layerA 3D printer is really only limited by how long you'll wait around for big prints. In essence, a printer is an extruder on two long, perpendicular axes that can move up and down. People have built printers with print areas the size of a sofa, but there's no reason you'd have to stop there.Cool, where did you buy it?I mean true, but that's like saying "nuclear fusion can be used by foreign actors too" as justification of WL publishing classified warhead plans.Hahahaha solidARE WE SICK OF WINNING YET?!r/The_Cardale rejoicesWell it's more that while you're grinding, the NPCs just kinda . . . aren't. If you were the only ambitious person in the world I bet success would be much easier You're wasting your time and BBB's timeBecause the marginal unit cost of a product does *not* in r&d; those are sunk costs now.That's not a good way of looking at it though. The weapons system was developed decades ago — we already had to pay the scientists. In other words, if you're going to claim dropping that bomb was $300M, you'd also have to admit that *not* dropping it would cost $299,830,000.. . . would you not?Hahaha I was having the same argument in the bestof thread. Everyone was adamant this would be 50k (which, by the way, is the absolute max Google has ever awarded)Catas is a ton of fun if you're there early, party with the Viking armyIt's an oedipal cakeWe pushed out a change to make sure it's dismissable.
