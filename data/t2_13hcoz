pretty much any upper-middle class can afford that comfortably if they really wanted to, which is much more generous than i'd have expected from movie studios who guard their spoof your UA to something that isn't Windows and you can get the pre-built ISO directly from that pageFuck that commissionWhat about lightsabres?TimestampsI just look at the display on the dashI can see your hole point.Congrats!

carriers don't make phones.

the best you can do for privacy is to use an open source android distro and encrypt everything, you can't trust the networks the data runs over.

anonymity is a much more difficult and elusive thing to do, since you have to make sure that they can't track you with your phone. in practice it's probably all-but impossible.take it in another direction... i've always seen retribution as a very non-consequentialist thing. it is something that you do regardless of consequences.

rehabilitation is much more akin to consequentialist methods, where your goal is to promote the most good among everybody in society by using things to affect future consequences, rather than a backward-looking examination of past actions.> I believe that Snapchat introduced a feature to make your Snapchats look like Instagrams.

I have a hard time believing that the two apps handle the camera so differently (or impose default filters) that make them have distinctly recognizable styles... don't users choose what filters to apply (or none)?

This is also bending over and taking a sloppy shit on everyone got laid off from the Nokia acquisition because hey, not only did we squander all their hardware but all their software and support and any further ambitions for a Windows Phone from all that bought out. For all of us that were hoping and waiting for something great to come out and naively thinking Microsoft is "committed to mobile," think again. It's not being committed to Windows 10 MOBILE, it's everything else iOS and android. There is no commitment from Microsoft to Windows 10 Mobile, that we already suspected, but this is insulting.

> For me, this has immediately turned me off to anything MS hardware, almost even Surface and Xbox just because that doesn't seem like it could be EOL'd, but having bought into Band 2, Surface 3, and Lumia 950/950 XL and to have ALL three of them EOL'd and discontinued really leaves a sour note. The Band 2 I knew what I was getting into with product defects but never did I suspect my 950 would be EOL'd by the maker of it. Nor did I ever think that in a year after, they'd just sell out and push android because that's what Windows Phone has been from the get go, a platform that just gave up every year... I don't care if there is ever a Surface Phone or any impressive first party phone, after all this I cannot even begin to make a recommendation of it because either a) it'll be EOL'd, b) support will become non-existent, or c) they'll just sell more android devices in store.

not to dispute your overall point but i think you're supposed to make the hidden partition the bigger one, and the actual data the smaller one inside it. so when you open the fake one you can't see that it's an obviously smaller partition.> agreed that the presence of child porn on his drives was a "foregone conclusion."

What's that? you can't? then it's not a fucking foregone conclusion is it?There. Are. Four. Trees!ask the referral service. they should have people near you.would make sense, since independents are the ones not predominantly and semi-permanently in either camp
