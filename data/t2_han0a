[The Sunshine Makers](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_sunshine_makers_2017)I've been using Record Bird but I think it's a bit of a no-brainer for Apple to incorporate. I still get emails from Spotify (that I've not properly accessed for years) telling me about new music from artists I listened to with them.I have checkbox options for "Announcements", "Apple Music, New Apps and More" and "Apple News Updates".I'm signed up for all three newsletter checkboxes and didn't get this email :(Why are they STILL not providing notifications or calls to action notifying users on new music released by artists users follow?!

For example, Real Estate released two tracks from their album in the run up to its release and I'd been listening to them frequently. But then, come the album's release day, Apple Music still only displayed those two tracks and kept the new ones hidden behind a message ("Show complete album") with no notification/call to action, email, iOS, Connect or otherwise regarding their release.Reminds me of [George Osborne](https://i.imgur.com/aQSrimE.gifv)That's a good point, yesterday I read about a pretty big farm bust that involved trafficking workers for the grow. It'd be nice if the industry was taken away from criminals, right?While President, Obama said that GITMO was "[used by terrorists around the world to help recruit jihadists.](http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/guantanamo-bay-terrorist-propaganda-tool)"This is accurate to how it was in the Great War. Back then, some troops were deployed with an enemy already killing them with a melee weapon at point blank range. I'd go to the Guardian with everything you've said here. I would love a game with a great story that I can play with my friend online, two player. I get faster speeds when I switch my VPN on too. It makes me concerned that they have some sort of deep packet analyses slowing my usual unencrypted connection down but I don't know enough to validate or dismiss that paranoia. 

Edit: I'm also with Virgin MediaI've had this before on my 2011 MBP, and it sounds absurd, but after googling and posting in forums someone told me to just 'wait it out', so I left it going before bed and it had progressed when I woke up. No harm in trying that, it could just take an unreasonable amount of time. Can confirm, mine does this reliably. https://youtu.be/TzwALcR98N4I can't cite specifics but you can look into it (I just woke up), but from what I understand, a lot of bad intel obtained by 'enhanced interrogation' was operated on during the Iraq war simply because the victims just told US interrogators whatever they wanted to hear so they'd stop. 
Its a very dangerous means of intelligence collection and it often puts more lives at risk than you'd think. The amount of adverts on that site interfering with the content is completely unacceptable. They don't have a majority if the SNP, Lib Dems and Labour all plan to push back (which the first two have made it quite clear that they plan to).

edit: formattingDavid Cameron's wedding. Can confirm. Spotify does this, I don't know how Apple Music doesn't. They're still years behind. yesPerhaps u/Ojan_at_pax could help?Nice site. Could the cursor be in the search box so that one could just start typing as soon as the site loads?It won't change anything directly but the last big petition to legalise cannabis received a lot of attention and is still being cited in the media and politicians to hold drug policy to account. It produces something tangible to back our position. This happens to me all the time!  Sometimes with whole albums, sometimes with just a few tracks. 

Sometimes (I remember it was Weezer's Pinkerton) I had to just forgo it and use the 'Deluxe version' instead, but other times restarting my iPhone worked for some reason. One time when some Daft Punk track were greyed out and unavailable to me (songs that I've had in my library for years from CD) I just waited a couple of days and they came back. 

Apple Music is insane. Can confirm. When your team is made up of 8 1-2 player locked squads, half your team is snipers or nobody's playing the objectives then I definitely switch. 
If I wanted to play like that I'd play deathmatch. All I want is for it to pick up the last song I was playing where I left off. But every time I plug in it plays either a random one or A-Punk by Vampire Weekend with that damned frantic intro. Drive me nuts. Apple needs to get its pip together. Please could you allow an exception for players to who would like to switch to the losing team near the end of the game.
It's very often the end of a round when my friends and I join, and we get put on different teams yet can't switch teams because its 'Too close to the end of the round' even if we try to switch to the losing team. I just want to play with my friends. Please ease up the anti-spam delay when spotting enemies! The only reason I even 'spam' spot is because it didn't work the first time. 
And trust me, people in this game don't need any less incentive to spot enemies. Height 460mm, width 310mm, depth 500mm

Edit: I had a Thermaltake Soprano II case on there a while ago and it juuust about fit (it has a thick door). Serious?Can confirm, Friday night postponed. [Can... can I quit yet? Or do I still need to crash the game and restart?](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_one/comments/5ebwfq/whats_the_point_in_adding_a_quit_button_that/)Sucks all my time up loading levels. PS4 ain't very quick at loaded levels. Cool. How do I join a game that isn't about to end though? Just a threat to "British Economic Interests". I think that's the wording used in the IP Act that warrants highly intrusive, powerful and anti-competitive surveillance like this. 
The only reason for the law was for economic gains of the wealthy establishment and state. Ed Snowden cited this many times. Stealing trade secrets, breaching legal confidentiality and using surveillance to gain advantages in negotiations to protect or further "economic interests".

Is the Pax 3 stainless steel?On the prevalence of pepper...

>Louis the XIV was a notoriously picky eater and preferred his food as lightly seasoned as possible—he considered seasoning a vulgar act. In fact, he banned outright the use of all eastern spices beyond salt, pepper, and parsley (deemed more wholesome and exquisite than ruddy cardamom). Black pepper's spiky, pungent flavor provided just enough kick to the King's meals without overwhelming the taste of the underlying foods to satiate his needs.

[Found here](http://gizmodo.com/how-salt-and-pepper-became-the-yin-and-yang-of-condimen-1258049326)> The main issue has been that the judge who signed the warrant, Magistrate Judge Theresa C. Buchanan in the Eastern District of Virginia, did not have the authority to greenlight searches outside of her own district. In four cases, courts have then decided to throw out all evidence obtained by the malware because of the violation.

LE: "One warrant please judge"  
Judge: "Sure, what's the warrant for?"

Judge: "That seems fine to me!"  This is the terrorists winning. Same. 
You can just ssslowly heat butter and skim the scum from the top while it heats until it is clear. I got a Pax 2 from [Namaste](https://www.namastevapirizers.co.uk) a couple of years ago. They normally have some kind of offer on. The Pax is a very easy to use and discrete dry herb vape, nice, reliable and stealthy. Has a 10 year warranty too. 
[Pax](https://www.paxvapor.com/uk) sell them from their site too but be sure to shop around and check prices. This is r/BetterEveryLoop materialI'm on PS4 :(I guess their job is to play Battlefield forever and ever, round after round non stop so maybe that's why it was overlooked, I dunno. That website has an absurd amount of content that pops up, overlays, expands and whizzes on screen when I'm trying to read the article. I made sure to choose one based outside the 'fourteen-eyes' states thanks to u/ThatOnePrivacyGuy's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/4iho8e/that_one_privacy_guys_guide_to_choosing_the_best/).

But I was never sure how this data retention thing interacted with VPNs. Thanks again!

Bonus question, if you've got a moment: When accessing Tor sites, VPN + Tor or just Tor?Thanks for this reply. Do you think a VPN would anonymise one's traffic under [the UK's new data retention measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigatory_Powers_Act_2016)?When you hoover up all data sent over the internet you can use it to leverage an unprecedented economic advantage.Nothing new for the Native Americans.Confirmed here too. Dice wtf?They'll say the same thing to this study that they to everything. "Cannabis is a dangerous Class B illegal drug with no recognised health benefits blah blah blah..." and then give more tax relief to alcohol like George Osborne did year after year, reducing the cost 1p a pint to demonstrate how healthy and fantastic the government thinks alcohol is. 99% redacted for 'National Security' I bet.This is 50% of my spawns. A conscientious objector. * Sanders > Trump > Hillary

We got Papa Johns here in the UK too. Will boycott out of solidarity with Americents. Like my 6+ used to be 😑I don't know how keen Apple are on putting low power mode front and centre like that as it potentially implies that their batteries don't last long enough. Which they don't.Wait... you DIDN'T want to play [forever](http://i.imgur.com/9hhh3JA.gif)?How they shipped the game with this missed out is beyond me. I'd rather wait a little longer for them to fix this terrible menu than an immediate patch that'd just try and half-fix the major underlying problems and shortcomings of the Battlefield 1 menus.It looks like [Philip Hammond has given them some pocket money too](http://www.alphr.com/politics/1004666/philip-hammond-unveils-19-billion-plan-to-tackle-hackers). Just-in-time.I get this all the time too. With most of the things I upload and all. 
I think that Apple have just really botched the whole way this works and haven't gotten around to fixing it. 

Craig Federighi said in an interview once that their problem with Apple Maps when it launched was that it worked fine for everyone at Apple in California but they needed a much, much bigger investment in expertise and different user experiences to understand the issues. I feel like they get trapped in a bubble and a lot of these things don't get fixed because of that. I seem to remember President Obama scoffing at the notion that legalising weed would lead to economic gain. ThanksRussell Brand lifted the idea from Paul for his book cover. Don't forget African Americans too!Hi! Thanks for your reply! I don't think we've got any questions thanks. It was just on the trustworthiness of these kinds of services compared to this physical accountant.
Thanks again!Thanks for all this info! This is exactly what I was looking for, it's so hard 'flying blind' into this kind of thing, even after hours and hours of googling!10/10 would love this ability.Coca-Cola doesn't actually taste great. It's just crazy-addictive. I looked this up a whole ago and I can't remember why but using a VPN with tor isn't advised. I'll see if I can find the source.

It's made me and just about everyone I know familiar with the Adobe Suite from a pretty fundamental age, right through to my career. I can't imagine it'd be as popular as it is no if it had a bulletproof anti piracy system (if one exists?). I just mean both ways (iTunes <-> Apple Music).
So if I pause a song on iTunes I could pick up where I left that song on Apple Music on my iPhone and vice versa. Spotify has it :(Wash your butt. I didn't know that was a 'feature' until I realised PS4 makes you go round the houses to get in a party.So from the view of the justice system, undermining with vigilantism it is worse than rape.
