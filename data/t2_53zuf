This shit doesn't even make any sense. R/esist is leaking.If its 4 out of over 500 you will be doing as well as him. He didn't file bankruptcy on a personal level. It's amazing how many people think they are slamming Trump with the bankruptcy bullshit lol. He restructured 4 companies that he purchased because they were failing and he thought he could fix them. He is many things, but a bad businessman is not one of them.Not my first day on the internet, my friend. Appreciate the sentiment, though. Holy shit. So many lies in less than 5 minutes. Can I get flair for that?I won't tell anyone if you want to smash that down arrow.Ho Lee fuck. This whole time I knew this sub was parks and rec themed, but i thought it was "pander." P and R. I'm borderline retarded. Hopefully they shoot him instead of arresting him. Easy bill, we can't afford another lawsuit right nowLol WTF does she have to keep spending money on it? It should last awhile, right?I see you're quite the thinker lolYa, let's just ignore all the common denominators and keep holding candlelight vigils. That will stop it. $5 says it happened in a "gun free" zone. Hopefully he's an organ donor lol.Chicago style pizza is fucking garbage. A self hating Jew... How original. Why do you want to kill all Jews? Don't turn this around on us. This is your 15 minutes. You work for united. Get fucked. Ah so now we can add anti semitic comments to your resume. What a class act. Keep it up! You're having a great day. You're just on damage control because you know people are now aware you're a raging twat. If you really want approval tell the truth about the airline wanting the video removed. It's so fucking obvious. You look more stupid behaving this way. Are you comfortable with sharing your story?Hang in there, buddy. It will get better. Socialism. Socialism. Do you ever say anything else?No one's forcing you to say stupid shit here. If you don't like the consequences then stop saying stupid shit. Same thing goes for home invasions lol. I guess we would be better off if they had beaten in the homeowners head with brass knuckles. At least he wouldn't have had an AR-15 though! Such a safe world you're working toward. Why do you want all the responsibility on the homeowner? He didn't ask for any of this. Guess they should have done their homework before invading his home. They had already gotten lucky earlier in the day when he was gone and they robbed him the first time. Now they can't rob and potentially kill anyone else. He did a favor for law abiding citizens by making all of them safer. If you're too stupid to understand stuff the rest of us learned by 3rd grade then I certainly can't help you. You should become a public defender. Then you can help criminals get back on the street as much as you want. You clearly respect the lifestyles. Maybe just become a home invader yourself if it ever becomes safer for them. You spelled justice wrong again. No one forced them to rob that house. You just don't like seeing criminals get what's coming to them. It's really really really fucking simple, don't rob people and your chances of being killed evaporate. It's not rocket surgery. I like justice, not death. If the kids didn't want to potentially get killed they should have gotten jobs instead of trying to steal from everyone who actually worked for their possessions. They knew it was wrong and they knew the consequences. Cost of their "profession" lol.Why are you so sad for the criminals? They robbed houses on a regular basis. How about feeling sympathy for the guy that had to shoot them because they broke into his home and potentially would have raped/killed anyone in it. You have career criminal friends or something?Why do you hope they got a warning then? Do you try to come up with clever insults to hide your stupidity?Why do you care so much about ***what kind*** of gun he used? He defended his home from potential killers. Why do you want killers to have a more level playing field?Why are the most retarded people always convinced that everyone else is wrong?Tulsa is safer without them. The homeowner did everyone here a favor. They give him a warning when they broke in? "Hey, you mind if we Rob/possibly kill you?" You absolute schmuck. Big, if true.No one gives a fuckOh, boy. They don't like facts here lol. Ya I was really excited when they said that for the original Destiny. Then one day they just stopped talking about the PC version and it disappeared from all marketing material. It sucked lol. This time looks more like a sure thing, but it seems you can only preorder the standard edition for PC right now so I will wait till August or so before I get my hopes up. Probably nothing to worry about. IT'S ALL A LIEEEE! Seriously though, looks interesting. I wish this would come out for PC. Was so happy when the first one was going to be on all 3 major platforms and then they ripped it away. Still a very fun game (I got it for ps4).Generally you need something worth responding to genius. Such edgeJellyHow many fucking subs are you dickheads going to force people to block?> they're still in debate about genders

***My sides*** LMAOI really enjoyed the talk, my friend. We actually agree on a ton of points you just made. Just not about where the line should be. I started laughing hard when you mentioned bringing in food. We actually do that in one of my companies and would do it with the other, but the nature of the job is travel focused so we can't. Good luck out there my man and keep the strong debate skills honed!They are happy. I don't disagree with unhappy employees being bad for business. Just thought it was a weird response to a pretty common phrase. Anyway neutral luck to ya then. One clearly states 500 already exist. I have been in one. Dear god learn to read.What is that like a vague threat lol?Large? No. We employ 22 across 3 businesses. So 3 small llcs. Anyway good luck with whatever it is you guys are up to here lol. Do you give the same respect to flat earthers? Time will tell. LMAO This is gold. Lmao such edge. R/im14andthisisdeep.> And you think wrong.

No, you do, but it's alright that we don't agree. I've done my manual labor. Ditches, pipe fences, barbed wire fences, cattle, hogs, concrete, and many more. I know what manual jobs are worth and all the ones I listed are more demanding than working Mcdonalds. 15 an hour for some jobs is ridiculous. Anyway, good luck out there.I've already linked multiple sources. Read lol.Some still think it's flat lol. Some think there are more than two genders. Both are wrong. I think the job dictates the wage. You can't throw a blanket over every job and say it is worth 15 an hour. I happen to own businesses that require much more salary than that so it doesn't really affect me, but that doesn't mean I can't disagree with the principle of it. They are literally targeting states that are passing min wage increases first. It's happening as we speak. I have only seen one that was completed. You may be right about there being a transition period. Which part? The risk part or the part where people get paid so they can raise families? How do you think the system works lol?There is no way to do that and save money for my industries or I would consider it. None of my employees are losing money working for me lol. 2 in the service industry and one import/export that has very few employees. Being against an artificially high minimum wage doesn't mean I pay my employees shit.  They all make above the respective industry standard. Other than Mcdonalds saying they would target states raising min wage first? As in implement automation there faster? I guess if you think they are lying then there is no evidence lol. How is not artificially increasing the minimum wage a handout? I pay all my employees above well industry standards for their respective jobs btw. I never said it would never happen. I said artificially increasing the minimum wage would accelerate it. Parasites like me took a huge risk and now enable millions of people to raise families lol. I treat all of my employees very well and there are many other companies that do the same. The ones I have seen are only kiosks. There are people there, but they are not taking orders. How many people do you provide with the means to buy food for their families and put a roof over their heads? I would guess not many. Just a ton of lost jobs, but who cares when we get to stick it to the *man* right?They still have cooks, but the ordering kiosks are in the lobbies. Are you being intentionally thick?So you guys hate anyone that employs people? Are you all farmers? Roughly 500 restaurants in Florida, New York and California now have the automated ordering stations, and restaurants in Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., will be outfitted in 2017, according to CNNMoney.Roughly 500 restaurants in Florida, New York and California now have the automated ordering stations, and restaurants in Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., will be outfitted in 2017, according to CNNMoney.So do you buy products from any company at all? Did you build the PC you are using on your farm? You support this terribly evil machine every day lol. I treat my employees very well and there are many other companies out there doing the same thing every day. It seems you are unhappy in general and want to blame everyone else. If it weren't for these pesky corporations I bet you would have everything you ever wanted and we would live in a utopia. What are you even trying to say other than you don't like the food? Do a little research. Their profits are at an all time high. People are eating there even if you aren't lol. LMAO all businesses are bad then. What a joke. This is like r/im14andthisisdeep material.You're surprised that the bern circle jerk is strong? Sorry I'm not bluepilled beyond coherent thought.How is it a hypothetical if that is literally what is happening? McDonalds even said they were accelerating the automation process in states that implemented artificial wage increases first. You couldn't be more wrong.

This pretty much covers it. OMG, an anecdotal story from a payroll worker! Clearly all businesses have high margins and screw their workers over. Hilarious. I understand 3 of my own businesses, but nice guess lol. Apparently for you, it is lol.You could reevaluate the NASA budget.OK? I'm sure they were heartbroken. Millions of people still will.It's not a boogeyman. It's literally happening all over the nation. Just google automation. It's just just Mcdonalds and there are many factors driving it. If you think it's some made up nonsense to keep wages down you aren't paying attention. Oh, and what am I doing here? Just having a talk with random people on the internet. The only part you don't like is I broke your echo chamber for a bit and you apparently aren't used to dissenting viewpoints here."Somewhat untrue." Lol so you do think there are more than two genders?It's being done as we speak lol. It will speed up if we artificially increase wages.Trying to start shit by stating a basic fact that even children can understand? Talk about fragile. Sorry, didn't realize this was a safe space. I've had some great conversations in this thread, but this guy was not part of any of them lol. Dude your now doing the same thing he is. Saying the same thing over and over won't change anything. It makes sense than you guys are still berning out lolSo if you can't come up with a good counter argument you just go gatekeeper and accuse people of being a troll. Go deeper in my comment history please lol. If your tepid beliefs can be shaken this easily you may want to reconsider your position. If you think of it as just being a PC and touch screen I would estimate about 500 bucks a station. So call it 1500ish per location. That's a one time cost on a machine that takes almost nothing to maintain. The software already exists and you can use it at all your locations. It could be considered a separate cost. R/all, Mr. Gatekeeper. Is that allowed?Lol wut? What are you trying to say man? You have replied to all my comments on this thread and only one of your responses was coherent. Take a break from Reddit maybe?Are you Jeff Goldblum? 

No the MP3 part threw me off, but I was just being a dick anyway. Great username.Well thank you lolIdk if you know what automated revolution means lol
