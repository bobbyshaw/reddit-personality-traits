It hasn't been mentioned on this thread yet, but just to show her clueless she is, she is being roundly mocked on twitter for something else she said in the same interview:

>But in her Marr interview, Rudd reiterated that she did not see legislation as the answer, preferring instead to convince tech companies to voluntarily agree to tackle the issue.

>She said it was a case of getting together "the best people who understand the technology, **who understand the necessary hashtags**, to stop this stuff even being put up, not just taking it down, stop it getting up in the first place."

There is no direct equivalent of the Home Secretary in the US, but the closest equivalent might be the Attorney General.

There seem to be a traditional in the UK that anyone who becomes Home Secretary turns into an authoritarian nut job within a week. My belief is that the permanent staff of the department sit down a new Home Secretary on day one and scare the shit out of them, along the lines of "You need to bring us more authoritarian laws or the terrorists will put your head on a spike and there will be blood flowing in the streets"%N%t2_c2rxy%N%Intellect,Curiosity,Openness to change%N%

I'm much more worried about insane wealth accumulations in the hands of the super-rich, big private and unaccountable corporations, and governments, than I am worried about the terrorists.  The threat from terrorism is purely theoretical in my eyes, whereas I've been constantly raped by the super-rich daily, just by doing work for hire in a corporate environment, and then raped by a landlord charging me rent which is immoral in and of itself, but even if we bend the morality a bit and say 30% of your income is an OK-ish rent, then that still means 40% is immoral and so on.

Don't these *mother fuckers dare* to try to use the threat of terrorists against me!!  I will absolutely never believe it.

Fuck you the status quo superstructures, the super-rich, the corporations, the governments.

I'm not a fan of terrorists either, but if I get blown up by a terrorist, that's an accident, whereas if I am raped by the super-rich that's not an accident, that's a well oiled system that's working as designed.%N%t2_542l5%N%Intellect,Curiosity,Openness to change%N%

Some fellow Reddit folks concerned about privacy and security issues might be interested in an open source Android App that we have built.
It's called Umbrella  App. It's free, open source, on Android and contains tons of lessons on privacy related issues like digital and physical security.

Umbrella has everything from how to do basic stuff like communicate with basic tools like Signal to sending a secure email with PGP. However, the unique bit is we also have stuff on the physical side, like how to plan travel, cross borders, set-up a secure physical meeting, deal with detecting surveillance, covering a protest, respond to a kidnapping etc. Basically we have tried to make it a bit of a one-stop-shop for security for regular people, activists, refugees and journalists. We also pull security feeds from places like the UN, Centres for Disease Control etc - which is obviously very important to folks in places like Syria or affected by Zika/Ebola.

Do they actually believe making encryption apps illegal will stop terrorists from using them? It sounds like they believe there's a magic button you can press to make things disappear from the internet. The only ones who will get their privacy violated from this are law abiding citizens.

If a terrorist or a criminal wants to get hold of encrypted technologies, there is nothing the government can do to stop them. They are clearly technological illiterates to even suggest such a dumb idea. Sometimes I feel there should be an age limit for how old people who run our countries should be allowed to be. Maximum 45 years old sounds about right.
