Consolidation is needed in this market."See that big house and fancy car of mine over there, and two adorable young children playing tennis and laughing in my back yard with my wife?  She could have been you."

Happiness is the best revenge.I guess pissing the NSA off wasn't the good idea they originally thought it was!They can do whatever the hell they want, they own you.  Use Tails.Finally, someone who gets it.Doh, forgot to edit the script that pulls the links for me from another source, it's fixed now and everything else should have been handled too.  AKA - need more sleep...Dude, having friends is dangerous.  Stop it!Trust no one, assume everything is compromised all the time and operate within those conditions and you're good - right?[Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) is far better than VPN if it's privacy you care about.  

It amazes me how many people actually trust VPN providers - big mistake.[https://tails.boum.org/](https://tails.boum.org/)[LastPass 4.1.43 exploit by @taviso](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/845717082717114368)4.1.43 has major problems.Or make a really "fun" one up.[Source](http://nodecounter.com/#bitcoin_classic_blocks?PatrolX)[Trust no one](http://imgur.com/a/TOdGh)Anyone that thinks they can't be deanonymized is delusional.Total bullshit, nobody is going to prison on your behalf.  If law enforcement demands logs they will get them or the service will be shut down.  Of course if the VPN service is a front company of the NSA/GCHQ it's all irrelevant anyway, trusting ANY VPN provider is just plain dumb, you have no idea who they are or what they do with your connection.And even with this glorious setup de-anonymization is still possible.There's more than one reason Intel is called Intel ;)Nice tool /u/maqpOr the signals could be sounds, or vibration detected by the phone's accelerometer or microphone - at scale, with the help of some nifty malware.So about those pics of the wives, where did you post them?You should assume the VPN provider is "already" compromised.

Tails is your best option, but even with tails you become a "connection of interest" to the authorities, they know you're using it, just as they know you're using a VPN.

People that go to lengths to enhance their privacy are easily noticed.If the "unarmed" policeman that died that day was armed he'd probably still be alive.  When police are armed they're much more vigilant, their reflexes are faster and their ability to assess a situation quickly and respond is enhanced because they have to train frequently to maintain their firearms qualification.  The best thing this politician can do right now is to get all UK policemen armed.They don't need one, keyboards generate signals, signals get intercepted.Terrorists that pose the greatest threat use a [clandestine cell system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clandestine_cell_system) to organize attacks, they will use all the things normal people use in order to blend in and not be detected as an anomaly, but their actual 'terror' communications will remain within the cell and will be face to face.Don't need a backdoor when the phone itself is vulnerable.WhatsApp is part of the problem, not the solution.  If you want to communicate securely your method of communication needs to be 100% open source and 100% decentralized.  Freedom depends on decentralization, the more centralized our infrastructure is the less freedom and power we have as individuals.**Reality Check**

So, are you more scared of terrorism or road traffic accidentism?

Think about it, **very few people** will go to **prison** for **you**.

If law enforcement turns up and asks them to co-operate (turn on logging / hand over logs), most people will, and you won't know a thing about it until your door is kicked in.

People run VPN's for profit, not for jail time.

[90% of SSL VPNs are ‘hopelessly insecure’, say researchers](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/26/ssl_vpns_survey/)

Anyone who tells you a VPN is secure is saying it for money, because most aren't.They absolutely "want" you to believe it's impossible for them to intercept your WhatsApp, just as they "want" you to believe PGP is totally unbreakable.

What do they gain by having you believe them?

You'll keep using, and they'll keep intercepting.

They will never say "encryption isn't a problem", think about it.**Reality Check**

In life there are assets and liabilities.

Assets make money and liabilities cost money.

Your husband is a liability.

Reduce your liabilities, grow your assets.> He added that insider hackers like Snowden are rare, so it’s important for companies to focus on more common cybersecurity threats too, like those that come from phishing emails, he said.

Wrong, they're not rare.  This guy is clueless.Tip #0 - Be a smarter boss.They're manipulating votes, this service is junk.Beware of this service, at least one of their email domains is flagged as malicious / phishing.

You can have lots of privacy as long as you're not a person of interest to law enforcement.  Just know that if you take privacy to the extreme it gets noticed by said people, and they become curious about why you need so much privacy, then in a heartbeat "you're a person of interest".Encrypted email won't save you, nor will WhatsApp or Signal.It is indeed, and if he weren't so greedy he probably wouldn't have been caught."We're still doing it, and despite what is said publicly we'll continue to do it until the end of time."All hail Snowden, King of the millennial traitors.Don't worry I'm prepping the time machine, just in case.Apple's facial recognition, is insecure.Isn't that their best feature?Not procreation?
