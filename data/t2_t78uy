I think it's trying to remind everyone Ukraine is a historic nation with people dating back over a thousand years. Something which some Ukrainians feel is under threat from Russia recently.If you want to play games from one device on another then you need to have them really close together so the jpeg rays can leak into the other device. I recommend taping them together to ensure maximum connectivity.With a hammerThis actually makes me angry. Damn these idiots, do they actually believe this will help the supposed 'war on terror' or are they just randomly saying things to seem like they're reacting to the attack?

The minister's who spout this crap probably don't even realise that they use it everyday in its many forms (HTTPS) etc.Really? Nobody over 45...? It's not age that matters, it's the expertise. Not sure if trolling or just plain stupid. I've not got all the answers but you need to separate your own perception from how others see you. Nobody is too fussed if you're fairly quiet, so try not to put too much pressure on yourself to constantly be coming up with things to say, which can keep you tense rather than relaxedIt's old news yes, but don't think it's been posted beforeFor a second I was really worried this was /r/penmanshippornDepends on the distribution and your usage for it I guess, I've certainly found distros such as Ubuntu to be extremely simple to useRealise this may be somewhat old news (2 years ago). But thought this was too awesome not to shareYep, probably should have made that clearerTrue, but while it may not be ideal you can use wine and/or dual-bootWhat article was that?You may find [this](http://blinkingterminal.com/how-to-join-anonymous/) relevantYou've hit the nail on the head but I think you're missing the point. There is no Anonymous per se. Anybody who calls themself anonymous IS anonymous. All youtube channels etc. are either groups that operate under the banner or purely enjoying the atention*Wood* U like furniture would surely be better...Yeah it's pretty awful, I'm going to be improve itYes, you could use a tool to automate the whole process if you choose. The article is teaching people how to do it manuallyThey could do that, but wouldn't that be kinda pointless. It is to show a site is using HTTPS, Tor doesn't use HTTPSIt can be done but there is really no security benefit to doing so. If you want to hide your Tor usage it's recommended to use a bridge to conectBecause it's based on Firefox which is checking for SSLTor in itself is secure, it's the little things that go against peoples anonymity to track them down. 

It all comes down to good OPSEC. Using a secure OS alongside Tor, covering your tracks, separating different online identities. 

When people slip up in these areas then they DO get caught.I already have it on those other accounts I created. I should really stop making all these altsI was confused when he started writing down the 'n'On mobile right now but pretty sure you could just look it up.
The site was down last time I checked though.Np :)Yes! Always found that a little annoying, especially for the really remote villagesDepends on how expendable income you have I guess. You can get a really good deal if you're prepared to wait as it fairly regularly goes for dirt cheap on Steam with all the DLC.YUSSS BUY BUY BUY
Why are you still here?Cheese tournaments.. wait whatSome fine quality shitposting right there. You may drink from my skull anydayHorse fuckerWhat happens if you do this for your whole army? That would be such a messRant over? The best way I've found of dealing with cavalry is to just let them come to you. Set up your shield wall, with some archers behind. Eventually they'll all just charge into the infantry and get stuckAlways find it weird how it sometimes goes down in increments like that even if it's all for one thingMan that completely suck, I'd be mad right now. So strange though[And Rising...](https://imgur.com/a/ilJNZ)I'll admit my complete ignorance in regards to this things existence 2 minutes ago, but damn I'm falling in loveRipGood to hear, welcome to the lightThanks for the manual couch tip, it's gonna make tournaments a helluva lot easierCool, I'll check it outThat's awesome, one of my favourite banners too. What's your channel?Wait did you transcribe this from the screenshot opr did you have the magazine? I read most of the pics but some areas were too blury for me, not sure how you managed - Anyway - nice job!Isn't the "Calradic Empire" faction basically Swadia's predecessor though?Nice captures[Putin to the rescue](http://imgur.com/a/JzfL3)Yup, when I captioned "Lambs to the slaughter" was actually referring to us Vaegirs getting smashedAre you normally okay in multiplayer?Waiting to see this deletedHoly shit, thanks for the shareWho was that?

You must accept your fate, stiff upper lip and all that*gasp* The level 27?It's there, just hidden behind his headSpot on, the name of this sub doesn't really help either does it?*Upvote*
>Hahaha!One of the pros IMO is a different experience of the web. Browsing Tor is a little bit like browsing in the early days of the internet before it became commercialised by giants like Google and Facebook.  I find it strangely nostalgic in a way.I've been trying to tell people this. Nobody believes me...You 'factory reset' your PC?My favourite part is the livestream bit. On Tor? Hah.Haha I wondered whether you'd see. ThanksFrom what I understand if you're really concerned about Privacy, changing the settings isn't really enough as Microsoft are still recording data from youJust looks like a few Japanese fishermen to meHmm an interesting idea. The interface alone looks pretty sweet, who doesn't want to pretend there a command line hacker or something?

Security is obviously a major flaw but like you say, not its target audience, I'll be interested to see if there's significant development on it though so I'll definitely keep an eye outHope this isn't too off-topic for the sub but in my experience it's something a lot of users here are interested inI just like the way the ones on the far right seem to have *Some* organisation attempt going on at the top but it's soon overwhelmed by the swarm belowWhere to start... The UK is about twice the size of Australia... No Atlantic Ocean... The somewhat loosely placed locations...I think the worst thing is that China actually do have a plan. Like it or not their system of governance has been brutally effective so far and they are prepared to crush their own citizens to hold onto that stability.

That said, they are playing a catch up game with technology. As soon as they outlaw one thing another soon moves to replace it, and ultimately like you say, they'll have to give way to the internet eventually. Hopefully the freedom of the people will come with it.Only 6!This is me every day after CollegeAbout time there was a sub for The ImpsThanks for your feedback, much appreciated :)Lincolnshire/East Midlands anyone?Upvote for the interesting comment. Do you have experience in the audio world?Last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/5n6k6h/a_guide_to_browsing_the_real_deep_web/) seemed popular so I'm back with another, this time focusing on Security.

Many sites on Tor frequently go down either because they've been shutdown or the owner has taken it offline as they are normally just being run by hobbyists.Child Pornography is shortened to CP if that counts, you'll sometimes see it f referred to as Cheese PizzaYou need a fully automatic, then press and hold the trigger.
